Incident Response, Digital Forensics, and Supporting Investigations

- Incident Response Plans and Processes
	Incident response is steps taken when a negative event impacts regular business.
		Goals include reducing immediate impact and deterring future incidents
		To be prepared, you need a plan
		Should have a cyber-incident response team (CSIRT)
		
		Lifecycle
			Preparation - infromation gathering, missions, charters, project initiation tasks
			Identification - separate events from incidents and breaches
			Containment - Disconnect devices, use firewalls, do everything to separate the pieces of the network
			Eradication - sometimes integrated with containment - find the root cause and apply immediate remedies. Remove all IoCs
			Recover - restore negatively affected data, applications, systems, and evices to an established baseline/pre-compromise
			Lessons Learned - Using the gained knowledge, hold sessions, share new information/knowledge, prevent recurrence of negative outcomes

- Incident Resonse Exercises
	Plan review (read-through)
	Tabletop
		Examine plans, diagrams, logical and virtual walkthroughs to eliminate gaps/errors
	Walkthrough
		Planned rehearsals/drills
	Simulation
		Focuses on specific scenarios/areas
	Parallel
		Real-world drills while still operating business
	Full Interruption
		Real-world drills while ceasing business activities

- Attack Frameworks
	Cyber Kill Chain
		A succession of steps and phases used during cyber attack
		
		Phases
			recon
			intrusion
			exploitation
			priv esc
			lateral movement
			obfuscation
			DoS
			exfiltration
		
		Alternate 7-phase
			Recon
			Weaponization
			delivery
			exploitation
			installation
			C&C
			exfiltration
	
	MITRE ATT&CK
		Knowledge base of aggressive attack methods and practices
		
		Matrix Steps
			Initial access
			Execution
			Persistence
			Priv esc
			Defense evasion
			Credential access
			Discovery
			Lateral movement
			Collection
			C2
			Exfiltration
	
	Diamond Model
		Helps classify relationships between motivations, victims, and technologies
		
		Adversary
		Infrastructure
		Capability
		Victim

- Plan Types for IRT
	Business Continuity Planning (BCP/COOP)
		Business Impact Analysis
		Disaster Recovery Plan
		BU
	
	NIST SP 800-34
		1. Develop continuity planning
		2. Conduct BIA
		3. Identify preventitive controls
		4. create contingency strategies
		5. develop information system continuity plan
		6. plan test training and exercises
		7. after action report
		8. ensure plan maintenance
	
	IRT (Also CSIRT)
		Team that receives alerts and alarms
		Determine severity/priority
		May be pre-designed
		May be sent by insurance
		Can be internal or external

- Forensic Documentation and Evidence
	Scientific investigation of a cyber incident
	Need to be carried out in a standardized fashion
	
	Procedure
		Colleciton of evidence
			Always use write-blockers
		
	Chain of Custody is incredibly important
	
	Techniques
		Validation
		Filtering
		Pattern Matching
		Hidden data discovery
		Searching slack space
		Tracing

- Forensic Acquisition
	Order of Volatility
		Capture data in order of what's most volatile - likely to change, etc.
		Start with CPU cache
		Other caches
		Memory
		Tamporary file systems
		Disc drives
		Removable drives
		logged data

- Forensic Techniques
	Integrity
	Provenanve
	Preservation
	e-discovery
	Data recovery
	Non-repudiation
