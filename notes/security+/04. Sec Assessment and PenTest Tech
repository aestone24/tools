Sec Assessment and PenTest Tech

- Threat Hunting
	Investigators seeking out threats on a network
	Pulling up and analyzing patterns and IoCs
	Steps
		Gain and expand visibility
		Analyze
		Form a hypothesis
		Create the hunt analytic
		Execute the hung
		Investigate and follow up
		Revise the hunt analytic
	
	Can involve intelligence fusion, threat feeds, advisories, and bulletins

- Vulnerability Scanning Terminology
	Searching for open ports, unpatched systems, and misconfigurations
	Can be automated and run on a regular schedule
	
	True Positive - Accurate prediciton and is positive
	True negative - accurate and action not taken
	False positive - inaccurate and action taken
	False negative - inaccurate and action not taken
	
	Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
		ID, description, at least one public recrd
		Used by national vulnerability database
		from MITRE.org
	
	Common Vulnerability Scoring System
		Standard for weighing severity
		Uniform and consistent method ranging 0 to 10
	
	Web vuln scanning
		Most common scanners will test to look for
		XSS
		SQL and other injections
		Broken quthentication/session management
		Insecure object references
		Insecure server configuration
		Exposing sensitive data

- Vulnerability Scanning Tools
	Nessus
	OpenVAS
	Core Impact
	Nexpose
	GFI LanGuard
	Burp Suite
	
	Network Scanning Tools
		Scan IPs, ports, device locations in graphical XML view

- Syslog and SIEM
	Syslog
		standard system logging protocol
		Sends system info or event messages to a designated syslog server or SIEM system
		Used to gather various device logs from different systems
		
		Severity Categories
			0 - emergency
			1 - alert
			2 - critical
			3 - error
			4 - warning
			5 - notice
			6 - information
			7 - debug
		
	SIEM
		Combination of security event management and security information management
		Centralize large amounts of data to be used for mining, querying, etc.

- Security Orchestration, Automation, Response
	Automation
		Generating a single task to run automatically
	Orchestration
		Managing several automated tasks or processes
		Combines multiple individual tasks
	
	SOAR
		Assortment of software services and tools
		Simplifies and aggregates
		Should automate where the process is routine and monotonous

- PenTesting Technology
	Black box is a technique where you have no knowledge of the system
		Usually done by a third party
		Also a name for software testing where you know nothing of the internal code
		
	White Box
		Involves detailed investigation of internal logic, structure, and configuration
	
	Gray box falls in between
	
	Credentialed vs non-credentialed
		Whether or not you start with access to an existing directory user account
	
	Intrusive vs non-intrusive
		aka passive vs active
		Promiscuous vs in-line

- Penetration Testing Fundamentals
	ROE (bug bounty)
	Recon and initial engagement
		May involve OSINT and social engineering
	Privilege escalation
		Attempting to get root or admin credentials to as many systems as possible
		Methodology
			Check OS and kernel
			Check all users and privilege levels
			List SUID (linux)
			View installed packages, programs, and running services
			Goal is to find vulnerabilities in any of these levels
	Lateral movement and pivoting
	Establishing persistence

- Passive Recon
	Less-intrusive, low impact to ops or employees
	Uses paket sniffers, passive scanners, or network taps
	Goal is to gather metadata and copies of frames/packets with NO remaining footprint

- Active Recon
	Involves an action that could be tied back to the actor
	
	Examples
		Port and address scanning
		Vuln scanning (Nessus)
		Web application scans with ZAP or Burp Suite
		Banner grabbing HTTP and FTP
		Active fingerprinting

- Exercise Teams
	Red Team (Offense)
		Vuln Assessments
		PenTesting
		Social Engineering
	Purple Team (Common goal)
		Improving organization
		Security Posture
	Blue Team (Defense)
		Implementing controls
		Security monitoring
		Incident response
	White Team (Observers)
