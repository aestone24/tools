Wireless, Mobile, and Embedded

- Wireless Cryptographic and Authentication Protocols
	WPA - TKIP, PSK, Deprecated
	WPA2 - CCMP, PSK
	
	EAP variants
		MD5 - poor, easy
		TLS - very secure, hard
		TTLS - secure, moderate
		PEAP - secure, moderate
		FAST - secure, moderate
	
	WPA3 - latest security methods, GCMP-256, 384-bit HMAC, 384-bit elliptic curve

- Wireless Security Methods
	Personal - shared secret, manually configured, TKIP
	Enterprise - authentication server, centralized control, TKIP
	
	WPA2 Personal - AES
	Enterprise - EAP, AES
	
	Wi-Fi Protected Setup - vulnerable, never use it

- Wireless Installation Considerations
	
- Mobile Connection
	Cellular - many small inter-connected transmitters
	Narrowband - private, typically
	Baseband - also like above
	Bluetooth - personal area networks
	RFID/NFC
	
	Infrared communication - point to point or diffuse
	
	Wireless USB over PAN

- Mobile Device Types
	MicroSD HSM - features for RSA and ECC, good for mobile devices
	
	SEAndroid - android using security-enhanced linux

- Mobile Deployment Models
	BYOD
	CYOD - like BYOD but CYOD devices must be approved by organization
	COPE - company gives employees mobile devices which can be handled as if it's personal
	VDI - virtual desktop interface for mobile devices

- Mobile Device Management
	Enterprise Mobility Management
		Combination of MDM and MAM
	
	MDM
		Enroll devices for management
		Remove corporate data from devices
	
	MAM
		Publishing apps to users
		Configuring, updating
		Securing and removing data from apps
		
	Mobile Content Management (MCM/MIM)
		Falls under EMM
	
	Geolocation/Geofencing
	Mobile Biometrics
	
	Containerization of apps into a segmented user space
	Storage segmentation
	Full Device Encryption (hardware level)
	
	SEP - security circuit to perform secure services, running on own OS

- Mobile enforcement and monitoring
	Sideloading - installing applications that aren't from official market
	Jailbreaking - like above but for Apple
	Rooting - grants full access to a device at root level
	
	SMS, MMS, and RMS often overlooked
	
	USB OTG - enables a device to act as a USB host
	
	Tethering
	
	Mobile devices for payments
	
- Embedded System Security/Constraints
	Raspberry Pi - keep updated, no auto-login, password, disable pi user, SSH keys
	Arduino - Apply same ideas
	
	FPGA - Systems with firmware programmed in field that makes them vulnerable

- SCADA Security
	Ex
		Facility control, water, traffic lights, etc
	Concerns
		Terrorism, espionage, sabotage

- IoT
	Nobody has incentive to patch after shipping
	OWASP IoT Top Ten exists

- Securing Specialized Systems
	VoIP - harden/patch IP PBX
		Scurity in transit
		Control source
	HVAC
		If exposed controls, hackers can change settings to unsafe things/gain access to information/use to pivot
	SoC
		Lack of security controls
		Root access concerns
	RTOS
		Code injection, privacy, shared memory, priorities, DoS
