Authentication and Authorization

- Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
	Authentication - process of validating that an entity is who or what they claim to be
	Authorization - Process of granting an authenticated entity the permission to access a resource or perform a function
	Accounting (optional) - Billing and chargeback on the one side, auditing usage of resources and reporting on the other
	
- Character Mode and Packet Mode
	Character
		Character mode sends keystrokes to networked device
		For the purpose of config or query commands on the device
	Packet
		Uses interface mode or a link protocol session
		Also called network mode since AAA is being used to grant access

- Directory Services
	Components
		Schema - a set of rules
		Global catalog of all objects
		Query/indexing service
		Replication service for data distribution
	AAA can leverage existing user repos for authentication
	
	Securing the directory
		Separate admin accounts
		Just in time local admin passwords
		Advanced threat protection
		Enable MFA for all admin, maybe others
		Secure data in transit - IPSec or TLS
		Maybe CASB

- Federation and Attestation
	Federation - trust between two domains
	
	Supports SSO

- Authentication Technologies
	Time-based OTP
	HMAC-based OTP
	SMS keys/passwords
	Token keys
	Authentication applications
	Push notifications

- Smart Card Authentication
	A form of 2FA
	Connect card to computer, or can be used for entry/exit in buildings
	Chip contains information that authenticates user

- Biometrics
	Part of MFA
	
	Fingerprints - vary from person to person and do not change over time
	Facial Recognition - commonly used to identify or verify an individual. Non-intrusive and fairly accurate. Main method is Principal component analysis
	Retinal Scans - Each person's retina is distinctive. Considered invasive
	Iris Scans - like above but scans the iris
		Both eye scans are low rate of false positives and extremely low rate of false negatives
		No two peeople have the same patterns
		Retinal scans can be affected by disease, iris scans can't
		Iris scans are non-invasive and can be done at greater distance
		Iris scans are more widely accepted as a commercial modality
	Speaker recognition - identifying who is talking (different from speech recognition, which is recognizing what's being said)
	Vein and Gait Analysis
		Look at palm vein patterns, finger vein patterns, and retina vein patterns
		Gait biometrics identify people based on their unique walking pattern
	
	False Acceptance rate
		Chance of incorrectly accepting an access effort
	False Rejection Rate
		Chance of incorrectly rejecting
	Crossover Error Rate
		Value of FAR and FRR when sensitivity set up so they're the same

- MFA
	Something you know (Password or phrase, PIN, etc)
	Something you have (smart card, token, CAC)
	Something you are (biometrics)
	Attributes (ABAC)
		Somewhere you are
		Something you can do
		Something you exhibit

- Cloud vs. On-Premise Requirements
	Cloud
		Conern is only layer 3 and above
		Identity Access Management and or SSO
		Programmatic or console access
		Shared responsibility based on level of managed service
	
	On-premise
		Must include physical security and layer 2 protections
		More control over access model and framework
		More flexible
