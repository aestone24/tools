Physical Security Controls

- Types of Physical Barriers
	Fences
		Class 1 - residential
		Class 2 - commercial
		Class 3 - industrial/limited access
		Class 4 - restricted access operation requiring supervisory control
	
	Signs
		Authorized personnel onl
		DNE
		No trespassing
		Beware of dog
		Caution electric fence
		Biohazard Danger

- Cameras and Surveillance Methods
	Cameras are considered a deterrent and a detective physical control
	Should trigger alerts when disabled
	Combine with good lighting, otherwise not effective
	Locate all dead spots
	Backup
	
	Industrial Camoflauge
		Often cameras hidden in landscaping elements, statues, tall trees
		Can hide other things in disguised ways

- Personnel Controls
	Have all guests register at security desk
	Temporary badges - maybe consider using photos
	Guests always need to be escorted
	
	Security Guards
		Detective
		Deterrent
		Preventative
		Provide rapid response
		
		Think about impact on insurance
	
	Robot sentries
		cameras, sensors, etc.
		SGR-A1 is wild

- Locking Mechanisms
	Considered preventative, but they technically only delay entry
	Locks only keep honest people out
	
	Picking locks
		Using a tension wrench to rotate key plug to find the lock tumblers
		Pick moved binding tumblers one at a time to the shear line
		When all aligned properly, lock opens
	
	Raking
		Takes care of moving certain pins faster
	
	Brute force - explosives, hammers, etc
	
	Types of locks
		Key locks
		Warded - obstructions keep all but properly cut key from entering
		Wafer/tumbler
		Pin tumbler
		Deadbolts
		Interchangeable core
		Combination
		Electronic combination
		Keyless
		Smart lock
		Cable lock
		USB data blockers

- Fire Prevention and Suppression
	Prevention
		Fire-rated materials
		Training
		Preparation
	Detection
		Fire detectors, sensors
	Suppression
		Containing and extinguishing
		
	Typa A - common combustibles
	Type B - Combustible liquids
	Type C - Electrical equipment
	Type D - Combustible Metals
	Type K - Related to cooking, liquids

- Types of Sensors
	Lighting - not a sensor, but used in conjunction with other controls
		Ex mercury vapor, sodium vapor, quartz, LED, continuous lighting, trip lighting, standby lighting, emergency lighting
	
	Types of sensors
		Photoelectric - breaks in light beams
		Passive infrared
		Vibration
		Acoustical
		Microwave
		Electro-mechanical
	
	Other
		Flashing lights on display panels
		Bell rings
		SMS
		Calls
		Silent alarms

- Secure Areas
	Mantraps - control access
		Only one of entry and exit door can be open at a time, doors lock once you're in, can't get out without authorization
	Faraday Cage
		Rooms that block electromagnetic fields
	Safes and Vaults
	
	Hot and Cols Aisles
		Hot aisles are between racks, cold aisles on outside

- Secure Data Destruction
	Degaussing - removing the magnetic field of physical drive
	Purging - using software to clean data off the media
	Wiping - overwrite every sector of drive
	Encryption - encrypt all files
	
	Physical data
		Burning
		Shredding
		Pulping
		Pulverizing
		Or just use third-party
