Implementing Secure Network Design

- Network Segmentation and Zoning
	Zoning is used to mitigate the risk of an open network
	Zones have fundamental characteristics defined by the security
	Public access zone = DMZ
	Public zone = access to internet
	Restricted zones
	All zones connect via perimeters
	Only the public access zone can interact with the public zone/internet
	
	Honeypots and Honeynets are isolated sites designed to appear valuable to an attacker
	They need to be difficult enough to crack to look worth it. If it's too easy, veteran hackers will be able to tell

- Load Balancing Tech
	Optimize application availability
	Routes traffic to servers according to current amount of work being done at each server

- VPNs
	Dedicated termination points
	
- Port Security
	Switches function at layers 2-4
	Can be physical or virtual
	
	Switch security
		Loop prevention, flood guard, root guard
		DHCP snooping for dynamic ARP inspection and IP source guard
		VLANs

- Firewalls
	Network or application
	Restrictive vs permissive
	Stateless vs stateful
	
	First rule that matches is processed, everything after ignored
	
	Next Gen Firewalls
		Layer 5-7 policies
		Authentication proxy
		Identity services
		IDS/IPS
		UTM

- Network Appliances
	Defense-in-depth in one unit
	
	Can do
		Network Admission Control (NAC)
		Bastion or jump hosts
		Proxy servers
		IPS sensors
		Port mirroring

- Advanced Network Environment Solutions
	Data Activity Monitoring
	Modern Endpoint Analysis (EDR, UBA)
	Hardware Security Modules
