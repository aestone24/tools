Social Engineering Techniques and Other Attack Types

- Phishing and its Variants
	Goal is to trick a target that a message with an attachment is legitimate
	Spearphishing - target a small number of people with specific access or vulnerability
	Whaling - same as above, but usually a high level executive
	Vishing - same, but over voice/phone systems
	
	Common indicators
		Vague greetings
		Suspicious domains/misspellings
		URL Paths
		Urgency in text
		Lack of contact info
		Spoofed headers/logos
	
	Business Email Compromise (BEC)
		Attack targeting companies who outsource, conduct wire transfers, or have suppliers abroad
		Corporate email accounts are spoofed or compromised to perform fraudulent transfers
		
		Phony invoices/transfers, C-Suite fraud (impersonating CEOs, etc.), email account compromise, attorney impersonation, or data theft of PII
		
	Pharming
		Manipulate or spoof a web site's traffic to redirect traffic
		Can be used in conjunction with DNS poisoning
		Remember that this has to do with DNS

- Spam Attacks
	Often is just junk email, advertisements, or chain mail
	Basically, unsolicited mail
	Could include hoaxes, money scams, spoofed email related to phishing campaigns, etc.
	
	Includes
		Email spam
		Comment spam
		Trackback spam
		Search Engine Optimization attacks
		Spiders and DDoS bots
	
	SPIM
		Spam over instant messaging
		Block people outside contact list to avoid this
	
	Typosquatting
		Squatting domains (domains similar to big companies), usually to harvest information, frive by, or get someone to download something

- Tailgating and Piggybacking
	Following someone into a restricted area without using a card to validate
	
	Dumpster Diving
		Attempting to find any valuable information in garbage bins or dumpsters
	
	Shoulder Surfing
		Looking over someone's shoulder while they enter valuable information on their devices
	
	Watering Hole
		Leverage a compromised webserver to target groups or associations
		Does not touch other traffic from other people

- Scams and Fraud
	Impersonation is first attempted remotely with IP spoofing
	Next verctors are phones, email, sms, IM
	Next is masquerading as a legitimate entity
	Goal is theft of financials, IP, PII, PHI
	
	Employees should be well trained through security awareness trainings

- Influence Campaigns
	Begin with gathering tactical information about adversary or competitor
	Locate key influencers or stakeholders
	Launch propaganda or disinformation initiative
	Goal is to gain a competitive advantage or confuse the adversary

- Principle Reasons for Effectiveness
	Lack of security and awareness training - should be a continuous process
	Inadequate acceptable use policies

- Common Malware Attacks
	PUP/PUA - Potentiall unwanted program/application
	Ransomware - encrypt key filees and holds them for ransom, usually for cryptocurrency
		Ransomware as a Service is now a thing
		Installation, Contact, Handshake/keys, Encryption, Extortion (in that order)
		Should you pay up? For the greater good, no, but sometimes you have to
	
	Trojans
		No reproduction
		Masquerading as legitimate programs
			Games, utilities, tools, drivers, patches/updates, shareware, freeware, system upgrades
		
		Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
			Create backdoors
			Use C2 servers
			Ghost, PlugX, Sakula, e.g.
			Can exist on mobile devices now
	
	Worms
		Self-replicating viruses that distribute copies of themselves on a network
		Can also tunnel into a system to allow for remote control
		Ex. Sasser, ILOVEYOU, Conflixer, Stuxnet
	
	Spyware
		Gathers information about a user without permission
		Can show malvertisements
		Often accidentally downloadied on P2P, download sites, bit torrents
		Your smart home devices can be used as spyware...
	
	Keyloggers
		Malicious code that records keystrokes and sends data back to a C&C server
		Can sometimes also be used to track employees
		Keylogger detectors can be used
		Ex. PAL KeyLogger Pro, KeyGhost

- Complex Malware Types
	Most malware attacks are multi-phased, stealthy, and polymorphic
	Examples
		Rootkits
			Placed in unauthorized areas to access data, monitor actions, escalate privileges, Modify programs, and conduct further exploits
		Backdoors
			Typically trojan programs
			Generates a covert channel to C2
			Remote attacker controls systems
			Can perform DOS on other systems
		Fileless
			Run only in memory
			Not stored in a file or installed directly
			Ex. Frodo, DarkAvenger
		Botnets
			Most common form of DDoS
			Uses a zombie computer and a master C2 server to remotely control
			Communication over IRC
			Bots can exfil data, log keystrokes, mine crypto, etc.
		Crypto
			Advanced form of crypto, encrypting a user's files to demand ransom
		Logic bombs
			Triggers the exploit when a certain event occurs
				Mouse moving
				File access
				Specific time
				Program execution
				Number of times code is run
			Destroy a whole bunch of stuff
		Stegomalware
			Anything done by a cracker to hide data in an unexpected channel
			Typically hides malware inside a file
		Polymorphic packers
			Malware variants that can change and move in stages
			Used in APTs
			Put a bunch of malware into a single package
		Multipartite virus
			Combines file and boot/system infector viruses
		Emerging variants

- Password Attacks
	Repeated attempts to identify a user account, password, or both
	Also runs against stored hashed on systems
	Lots of tools and techniques to crack passwords
	Can use dictionaries and word lists
	
	Spraying
		Attempts to access many accounts in an environment
		Test a password against many accounts
	
	Rainbow Tables
		Precompiled dictionary database of plaintext passwords and their corresponding hash values
		Can be used to find out what plaintext password produces a certain hash value

- Physical Attacks
	Malicious USB cables
		Putting a malicious code into a phone charger, taking input from another phone and running it on the computer it's plugged into
		Cable will be detected by plug and play as a human interface device so it can take input
	
	Skimming/Card Cloning
		Skimming overlays an atm or point-of-sale scanner
		Crackers can also clone credit and debit cards by stealing name, number, expiration date, and 3 digit code

- Adversarial AI
	Can include evasion attacks, data poisoning (i.e. model skewing), and model stealing

- Supply-chain Attacks
	Attacker infiltrates through outside partner, vendor, or provider

- Cloud-based vs. On-premise
	Cloud-based
		Data centers
			Higher technical expertise
			Better physical separation
			Fewer vulnerabilities
			Newer technology
			Better availability, resiliency, and durability
			Great economies of scale
	On-premise
		Data centers
			More experience and familiarity
			Transition introduces risk
			Single or few accounts => single points of failure to to unsecure access keys/management
			Higher social engineering threat

- Cryptographic Attacks
	Hash algorithms produce a fixed-length output
	Possible for two different inputs to produce identical output
	
	Birthday attack - named for the statistical probability of two people having the same birthday
	Downgrade Attacks - takes advantage of the option on an application to give up a newer and more secure method of communication
		I.e., using http instead of https, SSL instead of TLS
