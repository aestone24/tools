Analyzing Application and Network Attacks

- Privilege Escalation
	Leverages programming errors and system design flaws to give an attacker elevated access
	Can be vertical or horizontal
	Least privilege principle is huge for mitigation
	
	Check OS release of vulnerable system
	View kernel version
	Check available users and current usre privileges
	List SUID files
	View installed packages, programs, and running services

- Cross-site Scripting and Request Forgery
	Flaws in pages rendered by web servers, rather than the web server code itself
	Malicious scripts or code can be injected into trusted/innocent webpages
	Scripts can steal cookies, session tokerns, or other stored data in the browser
	Attacker sends browser-side scripts to end user
	
	DOM-based (Local or Type 0)
	Reflected XSS (Nonpersisteent or Type 1)
	Stored XSS (Persistent or Type 2) - stored in a file or database o server before unloading
	
	Request Forgery (XSRF)
		Forces user to perform undersirable actions in a web application in which they are authenticated

- Injection Attacks
	Often a result of a MITM or RAT attack
	Malware can inject false MAC or IP addresses
	DLL injection - code forces itself to run in place of other benign code
	
	SQL Injection
		inserting a SQL query through input data from client to server application
		Can read or change data, execute admin functions, and get contents of files on DBMS
		Can run commands on OS
		
	LDAP Injection
		Attacker exploits data not being properly sanitized
		Can go directly to back-end
	
	XML/SOAP Injection
		User input inserted unsafely
		Can interfere with application logic to perform unauthorized tasks or access data

- Targeted Coding Attacks
	Pointer/object dereference
		An attacker supplies a pointer for memory locations that the program is not expecting
		Can use null-pointers
		Can dereference a null pointer, raising a NullPointerException
	
	Directory Traversal
		Allows to access restricte files, directories, and commands located outside root directory
		Can modify a URI or URL to force web server into exposing itself
	
	Buffer/Integer Overflow
		Attacker sends larger than expected input, making the server overwrite memory
		
		Arithmetic overflow often leads to buffer overflow, but can be deadly (rocket launch jawn)
		
	Race Condition
		A system or software tries to do two or more things at the same time byt the sequence order matters
		These can be leveraged to get unauthorized access to a system or network
	
	Session Replay
		Steal a session ID and use it to impersonate an authorized user
		IPsec and TLS have anti-replay mechanisms

- API Attacks
	If API calls are not digitally signed, they can be compromised
	
	Vectors
		Login attacks - may not have the proper mechanisms to just keep trying combinations
		DDoS attacks - Deny service by sending a ton of attacks
		Leverage credentials - trick someone into going to the wrong site and capture their API keys

- Pass the Hash
	Windows-specific
	Plain-text passwords not needed - just the hash
	Extract the hashes and use them to gain access to other things
	
	Windows Safe Mode is vulnerable - most third-party security products do not boot

- Driver Manipulation
	Common vector - hardware drivers
	
	Shimming - stealing information and money from point-of-sale systems, card readers, ATM machines
		Can be an overlay attachment or sometimes an entirely replaced device
	
	Refactoring - change an application's source code without modifying the characteristics

- Wireless Attacks
	Evil Twins
		Malicious rogue access points - honeypots and evil twins
		an evil twin replaces an existing network to act as a wireless MitM
		Evil twin is similar to a honeypot, but the attacker attempts to appear as the valid network
	Rogue AP
		See above
	Disassociation
		DoS attacks against infrastructure
		Use Management Frame Protection to help avoid this
	Man in the Middle
		A honeypot induces users to connect to it and is unsecured
		Allows users to connect so that data sent through is captured, can also be used to infect the connecting client
	Jamming
		A form of wireless DoS
		Floods the RF with interference or excessive traffic
		Some DoS may be due to bad drivers on endpoint wireless NICs
		Modern anaged APs can detect other APs and classify as a rogue if not known
		Location can be plotte on a floor-plan map
	Weak Initialization Vector
		The reasone WEP is deprecated
		Hackers can easily obtain challenge phrase
		vulnerable to passive atttacks to decrypt traffic with statistical analysis
		Can be broken with dictionary attacks
	WPA3 Dragonblood
		Someone within range can have the ability to recover a password
		CVE-2019-13377: side-channel attack against Dragonfly handshake when using Brainpool curves
	Bluejacking
		Takes advantaage of sending contact info automatically
		Spoof a name saying they've sent contact info
		Actually, then, a message is displayed, really as a prank
	Bluesnarfing
		Much more dangerous
		Can steal contact lists, calendars, text messages, etc.
		Turning off discoverability may help avoid this
	NFC attacks
		Sniffing, spoofing, replay, mitm, cloning, emulation, DoS, jamming, blocker, RFID zapper, tracking, RFID malware
	
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks
	Can be benign or dangerous
	A system with the ability to view communications places itself between the two machines
	Maybe poisons an ARP cache on a switch to make it report to each host that the attacker has the IP of the other hosts, thereby intercepting all communication
	
	Man-in-the-browser
		Trojan used to capture and manipulate calls between the main browser and its security mechanisms ad-hoc

- Layer 2 Attacks
	ARP poisoning - MitM at layer 2
		Inject false frames to corrupt the ARP cache buffers
		Only works in IPv4
		
		Can be mitigated with port security
	
	MAC flooding - use a tool to flood the switch port with a bunch of MAC addresses to overwhelm a switch in such a way that it effectively becomes a hub
	MAC cloning - Cloning a MAC address of a switch port or other endpoint, then you can make your attack MAC vector use that MAC address
	
- Domain Hijacking
	AKA clickjacking, Interface redress, UI redress
	Hacker uses transparent layers to trick users into clicking a button on another web page (actually clikcs on the transparent layer)
	DNS poisoning is when an attacker changes name resolution information
		When DNS is poisoned, it can route URLs to the wrong website to steal information
	
- DDoS
	Try to consume a system or network's critical resources - disk space, CPU, memory, bandwidth, DHCP leases, etc.
	DDoS is the next level
		Man zombified hosts all DoS at the same time
		These hosts collectively are called a botnet - made up of a bunch of bots

- Malicious Code/Script Execution
	Code
		Generic term from which malware derives
		A virus is therefore an unwanted/unsolicited piece of code that can damage a system
	Scripts
		Script viruses written using script languages
		Either infects other scripts oor forms a part of multicomponent viruses
		Typically transfer from one system to another
