3. Threat Actors, Intel Sources, and Vulneratbilities

- Actors and Threats
	A threat is not realized unless there is an actor or agent
	Threats are not realized without an agent or catalyst
	
	Common examples
		Human errors
		Hostile cyber attacks
		Data breaches and theft
		Cognitive threats via social networking
		Exploiting consumer electronics
		Interference with infrastructure
		Natural disasters or structural failures
	
	Advanced Persistent Threats
		Long-term planned malware campaigns
		Pre-planned with cost-benefit analysis
		Persistent in activity and system state existence
		Often nation-state actors
	
	Insider threats
		Disgruntled or desparate employees with elevated privileges
		Always consider this possibility after a breach
		Can involve employee with fake ID or someone using "Shadow IT"
	
	State Actors
		85% of vulnerability is cyber crime, 10% from cyber espionage
		WWC involves many of the same avctivities as criminal syndicates
	
	Hacktivists
		Hacker activists
		Ex. Anonymous
		Often divided into environmental and political categories
	
	Script Kiddies
		Inexperienced crackers using script and pre-packaged viruses

- Attributes of Actors
	Internal vs External
	Structured vs Unstructured
		Structured
			Planned
			Organized
			Persistent
			Multi-phased
			Internal or external
			Exploit kits, zero-days, modules, ransomware
		Unstructured
			Accidental
			Non-malicious
			Drive-bys
			No AUP
			Poor awareness
			Email/webmail
			USBs, personal electronics
	Intent
	Motivation
		Notoriety, Fame, and THEN financial, political, organized crime, rogue states
	Sophistication levels or skillsets
	Resources and funding
	
- Threat Vectors
	Physical Access
	Local network access
	Remote access and encryption
	Wireless, satellite, cellular

- Threat Intelligence Sources
	IoC
		Network or host-based
		Artifacts of an incursion/ddisturbance
		A measureable event or stateful property in the cyber domain
		Registry entreis, files on disk/in-memory
	
	Vulnerability Databases
		Rapid collection and dissemination is very important
	
	Dark Web
		Deep web not indexed by search engines
		Can be reached with Tor
		Can find sources of malware, ransomware, botnets, hacking groups, etc.
		Also has gathering spaces for terrorists
	
	OSINT
		Any data or information that can be collected legally from free, public sources
	
	Also
		Automated indicator sharing (AIS)
		Structured Threat Information Exchange (STIX)
		Predictive analysis and threat maps
		Trusted automated exchange of indicator information (TAXII)

- Research Sources
	Vendor web sites
	Vulnerability feeds
	Conferences
	Academic journals
	Request for Comments
	Local industry groups
	Social media
	Threat feeds
	TTPs
	Word of Mouth

- Cloud vs. On-premise Vulnerability
	Cloud
		Threat actors are almost always external
		Access keys must be protected
		Many accounts to reduce attack and blast surface
		Managed security service providers and Cloud Access Service Brokers
	
	On-premise
		Biggest threat is privileged insiders
			C-suite or C-team
			Databse engineers and architects
			Privileged security personnel
			Disgruntled employee jawns

- Zero-day vulnerabilities
	Everything was once a zero-day
	Considered such before and on the day the vendor is made aware of the exploit's existence
	Zero refers to the number of days since the anti-malware vendor discovered it
	CVE is a valuable list of recently-discovered vulnerabilities
	Threat management and modeling tools are cutting-edge countermeasures

- Weak Configurations
	Human error is the number one vulnerability, so deploy change, config, and patch management systems (automated)
	Peer reviews are beneficial
	Test configurations in virtual labs or private clouds
	Don't be the first to try a new product
	
	Upgrade to stronger encryption
	Harden your systems
	Use security mechanisms even if you have to use unsecure application protocols
	DO NOT USE DEFAULT PASSWORDS
	
	Principle of Least Privilege

- Third-party Risks
	Vendor management
	System integration (DevSecOps rather than DevOps)
	Supply chain
	Lack of vendor support
	Outsourced code development
	Data storage

- Improper Patch Management
	Most organizations are weeks or months behind

- Impacts of Legacy Platforms
	Data loss, breach, and exfiltration
	Identity theft
	Financial loss
	Loss of reputation and goodwill
	Availability loss
