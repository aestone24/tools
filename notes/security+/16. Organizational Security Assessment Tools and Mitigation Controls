Organizational Security Assessment Tools and Mitigation Controls

- Network Reconnaissance and Discovery
	Ping - Echo request to IP or domain name
	Tracert/pathping - pings with low and slowly increasing TTL so wherever they die they send information back
	nslookup - ask your dns to resolve a domain name to a non-authoritative IPv4 address
	DNSenum - locates all DNS servers and entries for an organization, helps gather critical information like host names, IPs, user names
	ipconfig/ifconfig - pulls up all the local network information
	netstat (-a) - gets all of you tcp/udp information
	arp - looks at the arp cache and gives you the resolutions between MAC and IP and tells you static/dynamic
	route - shows you the route tables
	hping - packet assembler and network analysis with an additional traceroute mode
	netcat - swiss army knife, network debugging/exploration tool
	curl - facilitates data transfers (like for internet)
	theHarvester - OSINT tool that pulls emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, banners
	Cuckoo Sandbox - open source malware analysis system, used inside a sandbox
	nmap - network mapping utility, finds what hosts are runing, what services are on those hosts, OS, types of packets, etc.
	Nessus - vulnerability scanner
	sn1per - vulnerability and penetration scanning utility

- Packet capture and Replay Tools
	tcpreplay - open source tools for modifying and reiterating already captured traffic
	tcpdump - outputs explanation of contents of IP packets
	wireshark (formerly ethereal) - open source packet snifffer for network troubleshooting

- File manipulation tools
	head - prints first n lines of data
	tail - prints last ten lines from file
	cat - concatenate files and display output
	grep - search for regular expressions
	chmod - change access permissions
	logger - adds log files to var/log/syslog from command line, scripts, etc.

- Shell and Sccript Environments
	SSH with PuTTY
	PowerShell
	OpenSSL - commercial-grade toolkit for SSL and TLS protocols, but open source. Free under some basic license conditions

- Forensic Tools
	dd - writing disk image files to removable storage; bootable usb stick from ISO files
	memdump - extracts files from memory dumps. Performs automated signature-based searching inside memory dump
	FTK Imager - data preview/imaging, creates forensic images, uses write-blocking methods
	WinHex - hexadecimal editor
	
- Exploitation Kits and Password Crackers
	Kits - used by pentesters and malicious actors to find vulns and attack vectors
		Can prioritize vulnerabilities and threats
	
	Password Crackers
		Repeated attempts to identify a user account, password, or both
		Can run against stored hashes or offline, in addition to online
		Rainbow table
			Hash function used for storing important data
			Sensitive data often hashed multiple times
			Often also uses salts
		
		Eg
			Cain
			John the Ripper

- Endpoint Security Solution Reconfiguration Methods
	What are you whitelisting?
	What are you blacklisting?
	Quarantine and remediation?

- Configuration Changes for Mitigation
	Firewall rules and WAF WebACLs
	Mobile device managment
	URL and content filtering
	Data loss prevention
	Revoking and updating certificates
	
- Isolation, Containment, Segmentation
	Can isolate using VLANs, allowing communication upstream to switches, etc. but not to each other
	Using this method, any malware, viruses cannot theoretically spread out of its VLAN
	
- Secure Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
	Collection fo data and alerts from various sources
	SOAR runbooks provide a series of instructions
