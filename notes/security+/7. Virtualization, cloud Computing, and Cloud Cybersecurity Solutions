Virtualization, Cloud Computing, and Cloud Cybersecurity Solutions

- Virtualization Basics and VM Security
	A hypervisor is the software allowing multiple OSs to run on a single machine
	Machine running hypervisor is "host", the VMs are "guests"
	
	Type 1 Hypervisor
		Bare metal, native
		Exists outside OS - on boot select a VM
	Type 2 Hypervisor
		Exists inside host OS, VM hosted inside hypervisor on VM
	
	Vulnerabilities
		VM Sprawl - too many VMS to keep track of and manage
			Can lead to shadow IT

- Cloud Models
	Effectively VMs with economies of scale
	Security is a shared responsibility between client and provider
	
	IaaS
		Provision processing, storage networks, and other resources
		Consumer does not manage or control infrastructure, but may control firewalls or subnet
		
		CPU, Disk drives, networks, and data centers provided
	
	PaaS
		Offer OS, middleware, runtime
		Control over deployed applications and host environment configurations
		Common services include containers, development platforms, databases, security and threat modelling, etc
	
	SaaS
		Entire application running in cloud
	
	Cloud models
		Private - on-premise sandbox within an organization
		Public - deploye by a provider, i.e. AWS
		Community - deployed by a consortium in a sector
		Hybrid - combination of public, private, or community

- Cloud Service Provider Concepts
	AWS offerings
		Archiving
		Backup and restore
		Blockchain
		Business Applications
		Cloud migration
		Containers
		Content delivery
		Database migrations
		Data Lakes
		DevOps
		E-Commerce
		High performance computing
		Hybrid cloud architecture
		IoT
		Machine Learning
		Mobile services
		App dev
		Remote work/learning
		Scientific computing
		Serverless computing
		Web sites
	
	Manages Security Service Providers/MSSP
		Outsourced security monitoring
		Can apply to on-premise, cloud, or both
		I.e.
			Managed 3-7 layer firewalls
			IDS/IPS
			EDR
			VPN support
		Providers
			Fortinet, e.g.
			24/7 services
	
	Fog computing
		Decentralized computing between data source and cloud
		
		Analysis to network edge, resources close to where they're needed
		Akin to Hybrid as a Service
	
	Microservices
		Small independent services communicating over well-defined APIs

- Infrastructure as Code
	Defining cloud deployment of infrastructure in a secure and repeatable manner
	Files define the deployment
	
	Code infrastructure as YAML or JSON
	Use CSP's browser console to create a stack based on code
	CSP configures stack and resources as defined

- Containerization
	Containers
		Isolated abstracted applications with all needed components
		Portable modules across platforms and clouds
		Can be server-based or serverless
		Contribute to immutability - replace the container instead of updating
		Function like VM for application code
	
	Docker
		Containerization platform
	
	Kubernetes
		Orchestrator for container platforms

- Serverless Architectures
	AKA Functions as a Service
	
	Allows full focus on core product instead of operating servers/runtimes
	
	Serverless code
		AWS Lambda, eg
		Do not need to deploy a server, can run code based on any number of events
	Serverless containers
		Eliminates need to provision and manage servers, allows paying for resources per application
	
	Services Integration
		Integration platform software
		Integration Platform as a Service
		SaaS vendor tooling
		Custom coding by in-house team
		Function Platform as a Service

- Transit Gateways
	Centralized logical routed hubs in the cloud
	Can scale networks across accounts and VNet to keep up with growth
	
	Effectively allows connection (maybe via VPN) to one gateway which will give you access to all of the other things on the network
	
- Cloud Storage Security
	Includes block and object storage
	
	Objects are typically publicly accessed via URLs or API calls, make sure they are protected by TLS
	Data at rest in cloud should have server-side encryption with a managed key service
	
	Client-side encryption is also a possibility - encrypt yourself and then upload it
	Server-side encryption also an option
	
- Cloud Network Security
	Begins with virtual network subnet design
	Must evaluate all connectivity options (gateways, endpoints, VPN)
	Various layer 3/4 static and stateless firewalls
	WAF deployment on load balancers, CDN distributions, API GWs
	Managed threat modeling and DDoS solutions

- Cloud Compute Security
	Security group firewalls and VPC endpoint policies
	Dynamic allocation of resources and visibility
	Container security by design
	Functions as a Service can provide security
	
	OWASP top 10 IoT vulns
		Weak passwords
		Insecure network services
		Insecure ecosystem interfaces
		Lack of secure update mech
		Insecure or outdated components
		Insufficient privacy protection
		Insecure data transfer and storage
		Lack of device management
		Insecure default settings
		Lack of physical hardening

- Cloud Security Solutions
	Clous Access Security Brokers
		Software service between customer ans SaaS provider
		Can extend policies beyond local infrastructure
		Assist in implementation and enforcement of identity/access management
	
	Next Gen SWG (Secure Web Gateway)
		Protects your enterprise from mounting volume and complexity of cloud-based threats
		
		Web content filtering
		TLS decryption
		CASB and DLP
		ATP
		Visibility and metadata context
	
	Types of Audit Reports
	SAS - was an authoritative standard
	SSAE - standard for service organizations
	ISAE - issued December 2009 by IAASB
