Implementing Cybersecurity Resilience

- Redundency Concepts
	Duplication of critical components
	Passive - uses additional capacity to reduce impact of component failures
	Active - having simultaneous capacity in use (hot sites, eg)
	
	Geographic dispersal
	RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
	RAID Level 0 - data split into blocks, blocks written across all drives, uses at least two disks at a time, fast read/write
	RAID Level 1 - at least two drives with the same exact data - high read performance, write is slower
	RAID Level 5 - At least three drives, data striped across multiple drives, but also has "parity" data, fast read, slow write
	RAID 6 - like above, but parity written to two drives, four total drives needed
	RAID Level 10 - Basicall a combination of 0 and 10 - mirroring and striping - super expensive, but fast, minimum 4 drives
	
	Network Load Balancers
		Optimize performance by distributing traffic across multiple servers
	
	NIC teaming - group up NICs
	
	Redundent Power - uninterruptible power supplies, generators, PDUs

- Replication Methods
	With SAN
	
	Virtualization

- Backup Types
	Full Backups
		Back up everything all at once regardless of archive bit
	Incremental Backups
		Back up any file with archive bit - any new file since last full or incremental backup
		Slower to restore - last full and every incremental since is required
	Differential Backups
		Every file since last full backup - only need to restore last full and most recent differential
	Snapshots
		Easier and faster, immediate point-in-time virtual copy, has to be replicated to another media to be considered a backup

- Non-persistence Concepts
	Many admins need to implement rollbacks
	
	Revert to Known State
	Last Known Good Configuration
	Live Boot Media
	
	Non-persistence VDIs
	
- High Availability Concepts
	Availability
		System uptime - specifically, client's ability to access service
		Storage system is operational and can deliver data upon request, usually measured between 99 and 99.999
	Durability
		Long-term data protection
		Data does not suffer from bit rot, degredation, or other corruption
	Scalability
		Ability of a system to increase workload on current hardware resources
	Elasticity
		Ability of a system to increase the workload on current and additional dynamiccally added (on demand) hardware resources

- Order of Restoration
	Repair the hard disk drive
	Image drive to new drive or disk image file
	Logical recovery of files, partition, MBR, and file system
	
	
	DRP Order of Restoration
		Protect people and critical assets
		Sustain ongoing op viability
		Maintain financial stability
		Deliver value proposition profitably

- Diverity Concepts
	Technologies
		Maybe having voice IP AND analog landlines
	Vendors
		Having two providers, maybe
	Cryptosystems
	Controls
