Basic Cryptography

- Symmetric vs Asymmetric
	Cryptology - the study of cryptosystems
	Cryptography - the study and practice of securing communications
	Cryptanalysis - the study and practice of exploiting weaknesses in communications
	
	Confidentiality - hiding data at rest, in transit, and in use
	Integrity - ensuring data has not been altered while at rest/in transit
	Availability - protecting from flooding/DoS
	Non-repudiation - the original sender cannot deny sending the data
	
	Where does encryption occur?
		Application Layer
		Session - SSL/TLS
		Network - IPSec
		Data link - MACSec
	
	Cipher - algorithm for encryption/decryption, output called ciphertext
		Modern ciphers involve transposition, diffusion, and confusion
	
	Symmetric - use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
		Shorter key lengths, faster, more efficient, computationally inexpensive
		More difficult to secure, don't scale well
	
	Asymmetric - two mathematically related keys, one to encrypt, one to decrypt
		Allows efficient key management, good for digital signatures/key exchange, highly scalable
		Longer key lengths, slower, more computationally expensive
		
		Benefits
			Provides confidentiality
				Enrypting with public, decrypting with private
			Origin authentication
				Encrypting with private, decrypting with public

- Characteristics of Cryptographic Keys
	Definition
		A set of alphanumeric characters used for converting plaintext to cipher text
	
	The only element that must remain secret is the key
	Keyspace - the total number of mathematical possibilities in the set
	Key lengths often vary from 56 to 4096 bits
	
	Uses - Encryption, Hashing, Digital signatures, message authentication codes
	
	Keys can be static (used for a long time), session (single use), Ephemeral (short time, one single key establishment process, never stored)
	
	Key stretching
		Programs like PBKDF2 and BCRYPT
		Use pseudorandom functions applied many times to produce longer/stronger keys for other uses

- Block vs Stream Cipher Suites
	Ciphers are algorithms which outline the procedures that are followed
	They involve transposition, diffusion, and confusion
	
	Block Cipher Suites
		Operate on fixed blocks of data (bits) based on key size
		Measures bigger than the key size are broken into blocks the size of the key
		
		Galois Counter Mode
			AEAD
	
	Stream Ciphers
		Operate on a continuous stream by encrypting one bit or byte at a time
		Plaintext typically XORed with keystream bits
		Faster and less complex than blocck ciphers
	
	AES is ubiquitous
		Was the replacement for DES uing Rijndael
		Block cipher with key sizes of 
			128 bits with 10 rounds
			192 bits with 12 rounds
			256 bits with 14 rounds
			
			AES CBC and GCM are the most common

- Cryptographic Hashing
	Maps data of any length to a fixed-length string hash value
	One-way, theoretically undoable
	Birthday paradox is a thing
	
	Used to store passwords
	
	Functions
		MD5 - recommended to not still be used, 128-bit
		SHA-1 - 160-bit
		SHA-2 (256 or 512) and SHA-3 (224-512) are now standards
		RIPEMD (128, 160, 256, 320)
	
	HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Codes)
		Uses cryptographic hashing combined with a secret key
		Only as strong as the secret key
		Secret key allows verification
		
- Key Exchange Mechanisms
	RSA
		Original protocol for establishing secret keys
	Diffie-Hellman
		Original protocol for establishing secret keys
		Widely used asymmetric system (IPSec, TLS)
		Modes
			DHKE
			DHE/EDH (Ephemeral)
			ECDH (Elliptic Curve)
				Smaller keys, exceptional strength (3072 standard = 256 elliptic)
			ECDHE/ECEDH (Both of above)

- Modes of Operation
	Authenticated/Unauthenticated
	Counter/No Counter (Adding counter makes it more non-deterministic)
	Ephemeral (Using forward secrecy, maybe using a key derived from a secret key, only for one session) or not
	Lightweight Cryptography
	
	Forward Secrecy
		Perfect forward secrecy if compromise of long-term keys does not allow attacker to obtain past session keys
		Obtained by using non-deterministic algorithms to create session keys
	
	Lightweight Cryptography
		Most current algos designed for desktop/server
		Several areas where highly-constrained devices are interconnected - so we need lighter weight algorithms for them

- Advanced Cryptography Concepts
	Digital Signatures
		Scalable mechanism for providing authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation
		Does not offer confidentiality
		Random private/public key pair
		SHA1/2/3 alg
		Signing algs
			RSA
			DSA
			ECDSA
	
	Quantum Computing
		Uses qubits, typically subatomic particles like electrons or photons
		Power comes from the fact that qubits can represent numerous possible combinations of 1 and 0 at the same time (superposition)
		Adding qubits adds power exponentially
		Will eventually undermine cryptography
	
	Post-quantum computing
		Developing new systems that can be implemented with today's computers that will resist attacks from tomorrow's quantum comps
		
		Larger size, more complex trapdoor functions, lattice-based cryptography, supersingular isogeny key exchange
	
	Quantum communications
		Leverages laws of quantum physics/computing to protect data
		Transmit sensitive data using quantum key distribution (QKD)
		QKD sends encrypted data as normal bits, decryption key info encoded and transmitted using qubits
		Theoretically ultra-secure
	
	Homomorphic encryption
		Helps protect data-in-use
		Data remains encrypted while being processed
		Commonly uses public/private
		Algebraic operations on ciphertext
	
	Blockchain
		Public ledger consisting of a digital "chain of blocks"
		Transaction data succh as date, time, ammount
		Participants identified based on digital signatures
		Unique hashes distinguish blocks from each other
		
		For a block to be added
			Transaction needed
			Transaction must be verified
			Transaction must be stored in a block and given a hash

- Common Use Cases/Limitations
	Low power devices that need low latency and high resiliency
		Lightweight crypto and elliptic curve
	Must support
		Confidentiality
		Integrity
		Obfuscation
	
	Common Limitations
		Speed
		Size
		Weak keys
		Time
		Longevity of a key
		Predictability (consider dictionary attacks)
		Key Reuse (avoided with forward secrecy)
		Entropy
		Computational overhead
		Resource vs security constraints

- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
	Global scalabe secure way to distribute, verify, and revoke public keys using a web of trust
	PKI is an extensible trusted third-party architecture
	
	Registering and issuing certificates by a Certificate Authority, automated or manual
	CA is central trusted introducer
		Stores issues, and signes certificates
		Everyone has public key of CA
		CA has public key of customers (encrypted with their private key)
		CSR = certificate signing request
		No higher authority, so they sign their own certificates, but those keys are SUPER secure
		
- Types of Certificates
	X.509v3
		Standard for web domains
	
		Version number
		Serial number - used later to revoke a certificate if need be
		Signature algorithm ID
		Issuer name
		Validity period
			Not before
			Not after
		Subject name
		Public key alg
		Subject public key
		Issuer UID
		Subject UID
		Extensions (i.e. PKI extensions)
		Certificate signature alg
		Certificate signature
		
		Certificate extensions
			DER

			CER
				binary, indefinite length
			PEM
				Base64 encoded DER
			PFX
			PKCS12
				Standard for exchanging objects
			PKCS7
				Standard for signing and encrypting
			Wildcard

	Self-signed certificates
	Machine/computer certificates
	
- Core PKI Concepts
	CA Trust Models
		Single CA - responsibls for providing to everyone
			Must always be online
		Hierarchical - combination of root and intermediate
			Root provides to intermediate
	
	Certificate Chaining
		CA must be in trusted store
		Not possible to include all CAs
		Chain of trust
	
	Certificate Revocation/Suspension
		All keys must have finite life
		Certificate can be revoked (permanent) or suspended (temp)
		Extension fields critical for security and functionality
	
	CRL
		List of certificate serial numbers that are no longer valid or have been revoked
		Issued by CA who issued cert
	
	OCSP
		List of certs that are not valid, based on serial number
		Generated and published immediately
	
	Certificate stapling
		Client does not contact CA, certificate itself contains a time-stamped OCSP response
	
	Certificate Pinning
		Manual allow list of digital certs
