Identity, Account, AAA

- Identity Controls
	An IDP is a service that offers users or devices a single set of login credentials that authenticates and authorizes over multiple platforms
	Federated Identity - a single consistent profile that can be used over multiple platforms
	Tokens, assertions, certificates can grant access as well

- Account Types
	User accounts - usually just employee
	Guest and generic accounts - disable them when you can
	Shared accounts/credentials - just don't. Don't have these
	Service and Application Accounts - Passowrds usually not changed super often, so make sure you DO do that
	Privileged and emergency fallback accounts
	
	Problems
		Overprivileged users - always obey principle of least privilege and dual operator principles - need two people to cover all sides of an activvity
		Use separate account for admin tasks
		Lack of logging, auditing, reporting
		Assess vulnerabilities from privileged insiders

- Common Account Policies
	AWS
		Access management - groups
		Can give up to 10 different role permissions
		
		Account settings
			Contains Password Policy - set 10-13 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbolds, etc.

- Advanced Account Policies
	Geofencing/geolocation
		Geolocation is a point on a map, whereas fencing is an area
		Mobile Device Management, ie
	
	Attribute-based-access-control
		ABAC can be used for authorization solutions for API, functions, and micro-services

- Authentication Management
	Password Key Management
		Should be audited regularly
		AUP should have sections on password management and a clear-desk-policy
		Password vaults can be used for this
	
	Trusted Computing
		TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
			Tamper-resistent security chip installed on the device, stores passwords, certificates, etc.
		SED (Self-encrypting Drives)
			Encrypts data when written, decrypts when read
		HSM (Hardware Security Module)
			Tamper-resistent dedicated appliance or module
			Manages, processes, generates, and stores keys
			Verifies certificates, SSL connection accelerating, Encryption, and verifying integrity
	
	KBA (Knowledge-based Authentication
		Security Questions and Answers
		Statc - choose from list of questions
		Dynamic - Generate questions that have to do only with the specific person - i.e. 'Did you live at this address?' 'Did you ever own this car?'

- Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
	Provides an optional authentication phase before proceeding to PPP Network Layer protocol
	
	IEEE 802.1x (PNAC)
		Extension of PPP
		
		EAP
		PEAP
		EAP-FAST
		EAP-TLS
		EAP-TTLS
	
	RADIUS
		Client-server protocol enabling remote access
		Considered a desireable accounting solution

- Authentication Procotols for Federation and SSO
	SAML - XML-based open-source SSO standard
		Identity provider - declares identity of usesr
		Service Provider - takes assertion and passes it to app/service
	
	OAuth - JSON based, allows third-party app to get limited access to an HTTP service
		OpenID is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0
			Can get basic profile info about user with REST-like methodology
	
	Kerberos - SSO authentication using secret key cryptosystem
		Uses ticket for assertion or token
		Mutual Auth
		All comms encrypted
		Trusted 3rd part called a KDC

- Access Control Schemes
	DAC - restricts data and systems
		Advantages
			Easy
			Least Privilege
			Owner has control over access
		Disadvantages
			Doc must be strictly maintained
	
	Role-based
		Relies on org chart, roles, responsibilities
		Based on enterprise objectives and architecture
		Framework set by admin
		
		Adv
			Easy to implement/control
			Built-in to many frameworks
		Disadv
			Scope creep
			Audit requirements
	
	Rule-based
		Dynamically assigned based on criteria
		defined by sysadmin
