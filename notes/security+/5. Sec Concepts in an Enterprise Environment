Security Concepts in an Enterprise Environment

- Change and Configuration Management
	Diagrams and Topologies
	Baselines
	Naming and tagging
	Schemas
	
	Change Management
		Goal is to maximize amount of successful service and product changes
		Make certain risks have been adequately assessed
		
		Lifecycle
			Submitting - proposed change analyzed and validated
			Approving - proposed change brought to te right person for approval
			Documenting - change needs to be inputted into a change log or config database
			Testing - test and verify before implementation
			Implementing - deploy based on a determined schedule
			Reporting - submit a full report after implementation - if any problems arise, go back to an earlier stage

- Data Sovereignty
	Data ownership, custodianship, stewardship, usage must be agreed upon in advance in compliance with government regulations
	This can strongly affect cloud server geolocation
		An easy fix is to always have your cloud server location in the same country as the company

- Data Protection
	Proper labeling, handling, and least privilege access
	Different controls are used for data at rest, in transit, and in use/processing
	Tokenization can lead to data loss or leakage
	
	Data Loss Prevention
		Manages the loss and leakage of valuable and critical data beyond the domain
		
		Data => can leak => to an outsider => resulting in a breach
	
	Digital Rights Management
		Varied control technologies to control usage of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works

- Hardware Security Module
	Dedicated crypto processors consisting of hardened, tamper-resistant devices
	Will zero-out all data if compromised
	Can verify digital certificates, encrypt and decrypt, and verify the integrity of data

- Geographical Considerations
	Where to store offsite data and backups
		Geographically should be in a different city, state country, cloud, etc.
	
	Always know
		Jurisdictions
		Privacy laws
		Import-export laws
		Cryptography regulations
	
- Cloud Access Security Brokers
	Software as a Service providers
	Could be on-premise or in-service provider clouds
	
	Extend policies beyond local infrastructure
	Provides visibility, compliance, data security, and threat protection

- Response and Recovery Controls
	Accept
	Mitigate - reduces the amount/impact of risk
	Transfer/Share
	Avoid - take no actions
	
	Security guards are a critical response control - they wll often deter and prevent just with their presence, but also can actively keep people out
	
	CSIRT
		Internal (swarm) or third-party
		Should deliver a reliable and trusted single PoC for reporting
	
	Activities
		Recovering data from backups
		Conducting device location and remote wiping
		Testing business controls

- SSL/TLS inspection
	Hardening all web services responding to https clients
	
	TLS Best Practices
		Have up-to-date security software and settings
		update browsers
		Verify encryption is being done
		Get TlS certs only from trusted authorities
		Employ pinning/OSCP stapling

- Hashing and API considerations
	Hashes are only half the key strength due to the "birthday paradox'
	Older protocols should be avoided due to collision attacks
	AES-256-GCM is best, built in hash authentication and integrity with symmetric encryption
	
	API Considerations
		Digitally sign all API calls
		Do not embed ccredentials in a call
		Only connect to trusted sources
		Protect secret keys for API calls
		Deploy secure coding practices
	
- Site Resiliency
	Refers to maintaining durability of high-availability and mission-critical services and data
	
	Cold site - empty building with HVAC capability - can take up to 24 hours to set up
	Warm site - Will have some hardware, like racks, wired ethernet, may have personnel who manage it
	Hot site - enough duplicate hardware that it only takes an hour or so to get up and running - sometimes called parallel
	Mobile sites - above but in trailers
	Hybrid cloud - some public some private
	
- Deception and Disruption
	Honeypots and evel twins used in wireless networks to trap potential attackers and as MitM attacks
	Honeynets - entire physical and virtual subnets
	Honeyfiles or honey tokens - used to catch privileged insiders during a structured attack
	Basically, all of these are to figure out who is trying to break in but don't give any valuable stuff to them
	
	Fake Telemetry
		Adding a fake layer to your infrastructure to employ decoy assets, fake data, or anything to slow attackers down
	
	DNS sinkholes - Look at malicious traffic, analyze, and adapt - route malicious or suspicious traffic to an IDS sinkhole server to inspect
