Network Operations

- Network Performance Metrics
	CPU Usage on network device (router, eg)
	Cabling/Connectivity
	DNS Issues

- SNMP
	Managers (Servers) and Agents (report on clients)
	SNMPv1 had bad security, no encryption
	SNMPv2 was quickly replaced by v3
	v3 has good security, authentication, and encryption
	SNMP hierarchy is a tree

- Network Device Logging
	What happened,  who did it, when, and where?
	Audits cover security, resource access, etc.
	Codes
		0 unusable
		1 Alert
		2 Critical
		3 Error
		4 Warning
		5 Notice
		6 Info
		7 Debug

- Network Interface Stats
	Link State - there will be a light on the device
	Speed, type (duplex, eg)
	Send/Receive Errors
	Protocol Statistics (packets and bytes travelling)

- Network Interface Errors
	FCS Errors - packet has corrupted on the way
	Giants - packet is too large
	Runts - packet is too small
	Encapsulation errors - errors in packet encapsulation

- Environmental Factors and Sensors
	Must balance heat and humidity
	Need fire controls - stopping ventilation out, keeping doors sealed, etc

- Network performance/availability baselines
	Baselines need to be updated as things change on your servers

- NetFlow
	Cisco tool
	Used to monitor and plan/grow network, and analyze the network, i.e. look for anomalies

- Network Uptime/Downtime
	Uptime is time up and running and available
	Goal is to get lose to 100% uptime
	
	Downtime will cost you in lost revenue, recovery costs, and lost productivity

- Organizational Planning/Procedures
	Have an incident response plan including preparation, detection, containment, investigation, remediation, and recovery
	Software development life cycle can be helpful here

- Network Security Policies
	Password Policy
	Acceptable Use Policy
	Bring Your Own Device
	Onboarding Process
	Offboarding Policy
	IT Security Policy
	Data Loss Prevention
	Remote Access Policy

- Network Operational Documentation
	Physical Network Diagram
	Logical Network Design
	Main Distribution Frame/Intermediate Distribution Frame
	Site Survey Report - visualizes coverage areas and data rates
	Network Audits
	Baselines

- Agreements
	NDA
	Service Level Agreement (often cloud services use this)
	Memorandum of Understanding (Establishing partnerships)
