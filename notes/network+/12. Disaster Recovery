Disaster Recovery

- Load Balancing
	Distribution of incoming traffic
		Algorithms
			Round Robin
			Fewest Connections
			Least Time (Fastest Response)
			Hashing
			IP Hashing
			Random with two choices (narrow to two, then fewest connections)
		Hardware and software options

- Dynamic multipathing techniques
	Balancing loads across paths
	Multiple paths also reduces chance of total failure

- Redundant Hardware and Clusters
	Clustering, a type of redundancy, uses a group of functionally equivalent devices
	Clusters have automatic failover recovery but can be complex

- Facilities and Infrastructure Support
	Uninterruptable Power Supply
		Standby - turn on as soon as power lost
		Line interactive - responds to minor fluctuations
		Double conversion - takes in AC, turns to DC for battery, turns back to AC for outflow
	Power Distribution Units (they distribute power)
	
- Network Interface Card Teaming
	Combine multiple cards into one logical interface, allowing load ballancing and fault tolerance
	Active-passive - only one active at a time, other turns on in case of failure
	Active-active - all going all the time
	Adapters called team-members, interface is the "team"

- High Availability Solutions
	MTTR - mean time to repair
	MTBF - mean time between failures
	High availability achievable via cloud
	Hot site - infrastructure in place, ready to go, replicated
	Warm site - infrastructure there, replication needed
	Cold site - not ready to go, but space owned
	
- Network Backup and Restore Options
	Always have extra copies of your data
	Full backups always back up all data, even that which hasn't changed
	Incremental backups and differential backups only backup where changes have occurred
	Incremental looks at most recent backup, differential looks back to last full backup
	CDP updates backup in real time
