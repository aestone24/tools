Security Concepts and Threats

- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
	CIA Triad

- Common Network Threats
	Malware, phishing, DoS, ransomware - all external

- Network Vulerabilities
	Exposure - allows indirect network access
	Unnoticed code errors
	Use the CVE list
	
- Network Security Exploits
	Blank/default passwords (eg default built-in admin accounts)
	IP Spoofing
	Application vulnerabilities
	Default shared keys
	Service compromise
	DoS
	
- Principle of Least Privilege
	A user should only have the privileges needed to perform a job or function, nothing more
	Extend to computers, services, networks, etc.

- Role-based Access Control
	If you put people in groups and give groups permissions, makes more sense than assigning permissions 50+ times
	
- Zero Trust Model
	No automatic trust for anything inside or outside organizations perimeter

- Defense in Depth Model
	Layered defense mechanisms
	Security Control Types
		Physical
		Technical
		Administrative
	Control Functions
		Preventative
		Detective
		Corrective

- Network Authentication Methods
	MFA
	TACACS+
	RADIUS - 
	SSO - once signed into one service, other doesn't require authentication
	LDAP - binds user to a server
	Kerberos - AD login, authentication using secret-key cryptography, tickets, and a session key
	Local Authentication
	802.1X
	
- Security Assessment Exercises
	Vulnerability tests (gather information) and penetration tests (actually simulate an attack)

- Security Information and Event Management
	Threat intelligence, security analytics, machine learning, IT governance, automated remediation
	SIEM is very expensive, but has a SaaS option

- Network Attacks
	Passive - steal, but leave in tact
	Active - change, add, delete
	
	Unauthorized access
	DoS/DDoS
	MitM - steal data in an active session
	Code and SQL injection
	Privilege escalation
	
	DNS poisoning
	VLAN hopping
	ARP spoofing
	Rogue DHCP
	Rogue access point
	Evil twin
	
	Brute force and dictionary
	MAC spoofing (replace sender MAC in packet)
	IP spoofing (replace sender IP in packet)
	Deauthentication

- Ransomware
	Malware encrypts files, then demands ransom for decryption key
	Best defense is regular backing up of files so you don't need to decrypt that noise, just wipe instead
	Of course this is a problem if they're exporting the data and can leak it...

- Common Malware Attacks
	Stealth
	Trojan horse
	Virus - self-replicating, goal is current system
	Womrs - can self-propogate, goal is to get into many machines

- On-path Attacks
	Placing oneself between two devices to intercept communications
	Protect yourself with authentication certificates, SSL/TLS, S/MIME, VPN
	
- Password Security Attacks
	Brute Force - just try everything
	Dictionary Attack - cycles through common words
	Phishing - probably the most successful
	Rainbow Table Attack - instead of using a list of common words, use a list of common hashing algorithms
		Attempt to find the algorithm by recreating the stored hashes
	Credential Snuffing - Assumes stolen credentials will work on other services, tries those
	Password Spraying - assume an easy password is being used by someone - tests on many users, no clash with lockout policy
	Keylogger - records all keystrokes, requires some other technique to get it on the device
	Shoulder Surfing - just watch someone enter their password

- DoS
	Flood with so many requests that a system gets backed up and can't complete them, making it unusable to other users
	Volumetric - overwhelm
	Fragmentation - make packets impossible to put back together
	TCP state exhaustion - exhaust connection options
	Application layer - open too many applications, can't keep up
	
	Ping of death, UDP flood, SYN (TCP) flood (never respond to ack)
	
- Social Engineering
	Trick users into divulging information
	Baiting, scareware, pretexting, phishing
