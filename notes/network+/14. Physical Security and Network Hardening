Phys Sec and Net Hardening

- Network Hardening
	Disabling features that aren't needed, restricting others to just what you need from them
	Disable access to unused physical ports

- Password Strength
	Avoid personal information
	Avoid easily recognizable numbers
	Avoid real words
	Never write it down in an accessible place
	Use longer passwords or pass phrases
	Update passwords regularly
	Use different passwords for different services
	Disable non-active accounts

- Disabling unused ports
	Can use a firewall
		Can manage inbound/outbound separately

- Firewall Rules
	Allow, Deny, Bypass, Force Allow, and Log Only
	Examined: Port, Source, Destination, Protocol
	Default is deny

- Wireless Security
	Wep (bad) < WPA < WPA2

- TKIP-RC4 and AES-CCMP
	TKIP provides more secure transmission for WEP
	Legacy hardware can use this to upgrade
	Issue? Same key for all packets - could be cracked with enough data
	
	TKIP RC4 fixed the problem with four new algorithms, including changing the key every 10,000 packets
	
	AES-CCMP is the encryption standard used for government, requires newer hardware

- Wireless Authenticaion and Authorization
	EAP handls and defines authentication requests
	PEAP - used in wireless and point-to-point for 802.1x
	EAP-FAST
	Pre-shared key
	MAC Address Filtering
	
- Geofencing
	Defines geographical boudaries and uses GPS, RFID, Cellular, Wi-Fi to issue an alert when a device leaves those boundaries

- Security Considerations
	Don't have a network signal that's too strong/extends too far
	Maybe isolate wireless clients
	
- IoT Security
	More devices > more passwords > higher password security/insurance of no re-use necessary
	More data will be in transit, must ensure its protection
	Consider data segregation to this end

- VPNs
	Provides ability to access a public network in a private manner
	Uses IPsec to secure network communication and make a tunnel (data now encrypted), which also has an authentication header
	
	Secure protocols also include
		SSL
		TLS - helps avoid tampering of packets
		DTLS
	
	Host-to-site - One-way, getting onto a network
	Host-to-host
	Site-to-site - establish one connection via vpn concentrator at each location

- Remote Desktop Protocol
	Microsoft proprietary
	Take full control of the machine with visuals
	Uses encryption and smart card authentication, bandwidth reduction
	
	Remote Desktop Connections (above) and Remote Assistance (below)
		Someone sitting at the computer needs help, basically used to walk someone through a problem
		Think like your company's tech support - they can see your screen, tell you what to do, but can also seize control if need be
	
- Secure Shell
	Gives secure access to a shell on another machine
	Client is always the one sending the request, server is always the one receiving
	
	SSH utilities include Slogin, SSH, and SCP

- Virtual Network Computing - VNC
	Access a remote host
	VNC is open source, and contains a server and a client component
	Contains configuration option to only view but not take control
	Can be installed on windows, macs, and linux
	VNC, obviously, does not require a license, so it's much better for things like presentations

- Remote Authentication and Authorization
	Password Authentication Protocol
		Sends passwords in plain text
		Only used as a fallback now
		
	Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
		Authenticator sends challenge
		Password responds using a hash value calculated with MD5
		If authenticator's calculated value matches, access is granted
	
	MS-CHAP/MS-CHAP2
		Challenges posed in both directions with better hashing for authentication in both ways
		Microsoft proprietary
	
	EAP/TLS
		Smart ccards, Kerberos, digital certificates, etc.
	
	RADIUS
		Centralized authentication database which supports
			Dial-in
			VPN
			Wireless access points

- Out-of-Band Management
	Any way other than the normal way to do things (technically)
	Separate dedicated channels for reduncency so that a network/service failure does not stop services

- Video Surveillance
	CCTV
	Cameras

- Asset Tracking/disposal
	Inventory record details should include details on security, classification, possible damage if lost, and a plan to replace
	Maintaining inventory is important - can be manual or automated, size of org may play a big impact there
	
	Hardware asset management
		Mobile, desktop, laptop, server, router, switch, security, and any other necessary hardware
	
	Disposal
		Donated or sold
		DATA WIPING
			Important to do this instead of 'deleting,' from which data can still be recovered
		Consider demagnetizing if you really need to ensure it's never recovered

- Tamper Detection
	Alerts you if device is impaired
	Blockage - limited or no visibility
	Redirecting - turning the camera
	Defocusing, maybe with a lens or beam

- Prevention Techniques
	Identity cards, especially with scanners
	Biometrics
	Smart cards (aka ICC)
	Keypads - not as good as the other two
	Physical locks
	Education with respect to social engineering
