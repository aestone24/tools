Cloud Concepts

- Public Cloud Deployment Model
	Available to thee public
	On-demand computing can be very fast
	
	Easy to configure, can separate resources from servers
	Subscription-based and scalable, often cheaper than purchasing your own infrastructure
	Very available/accessible
	
	Tend to be very secure
	
	Limited control over privacy and security (still secure, but not your control)

- Private Cloud Deployment Model
	Like public cloud, but gives you direct control and you need your own infrastructure in place
	All subscribers within your organization
	
	More direct control over security, physical access to data
	More costly
	
- Hybrid Cloud
	Combination of Private and Public
	
	Privacy and Security slightly more in your control
	Managing Identity can be a problem
	Make sure you're aware of what dependencies are needed where
	Managing permissions of access to each database

- Community Cloud
	A focused collection of organizations using the same cloud
	Can be good for teamwork between organizations
	
	Issues can arise in security, compliance, and jurisdiction/ownership
	
- Software as a Service
	Software dist model using subscriptions, pay per use, no infrastructure investment
	
	Low time to deployment
	
	Easy administration, scaling, teamwork, and accessibility
	
	Security/privacy is out of your control, but still typically good
	
- Infrastructure as a Service
	VMs, OSs, Networking, and Security (NID, EDR)
	
	Can develop and test, backup, store data, host websites, or use it for high-performance computing. Can also host web apps
	
- Platform as a Service
	Kind of in between IaaS and SaaS
	Often used to develop web-based applications/services
	
	Self-managed and not very complex

- Desktop as a Service
	Streaming a desktop loaded on a VM from anywhere
	
- Connectivity Considerations
	Browser-based access an option
	VPN connectivity an option

- Cloud Risk Factors
	Security out of your control
	Privacy out of your control
	Exportation of data to another country (may be illegal)
	Ownership in shared environments is dicey

- Local vs Cloud
	Local can be faster, especially backing up, etc.
	Cloud is cheaper up front, more flexible, more scalable, more accessible from off-site

- Infrastructure as Code
	A service of building source code to recreate environments perfectly

- Multi-tenant Cloud
	Multiple people on the same server, different VMs
	Super common, helps not waste processing power
	SaaS, for instance - only one instance of each program on a machine, but let each program be used - no overlapping of memory utilization, use everything you can

- Elastic Computing
	Dynamic scaling up or down of computing resources

- Scalability in Cloud
	Scaling up - assigning more memory to a machine
	Scaling out - adding another machine
	
	Easy on cloud since you don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure
	
- Cloud Security
	Identity/role-based accessible control is doable
	Keep privacy policies up to date
	
	Good providers have good security, but if security gets broken on their end, yours and a whole bunch of other people's data may be stealable
	
	Auditing is doable
