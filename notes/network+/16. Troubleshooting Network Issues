Troubleshooting Network Issues

- Protocol Analyzers and Packet Sniffers
	Packet Sniffers
		Intercept and log network traffic
		Use includes establishing baseline of normal activity and searching for abnormal activity
		Software and hardware-based options
		Can find any passwords passed in clear text
		Can identify applications being used
		Useful for diagnostic testing/troubleshooting
		Can also identify protocols and vulnerabilities of network

- Network Port Scanning
	Identifies open ports, and therefore vulnerabilities. Check networking notes in ~/notes
	FTP Bouncing can be used to disguise the sender location

- Wi-Fi Analysis Tools/Techniques
	Can be software or hardware
	Maps a site and identifies interference
	
	Shows speeds, lost packets, retry rates, etc.

- Bandwidth Speed Testing
	Affected by distance (lost packets), obstacles (lost packets), wiring/interference, devices, and sometimes even time of day/automated processes
	Note the balance of download/upload speeds
	
- Network Software Tools
	iperf - measures maximum bandwidth performance for TCP and UDP
	NetFlow - Shows how information moves through your network, including path taken. Collectors and Analyzers are often separate
	TFTP - simplified FTP, uses UDP
	Terminal Emulators, like Telnet and SSH
	IP Scanners

- Command Line Tools
	Ping - test connectivity between two hosts using ICMP
	ipconfig - shows network config, tcp/ip address, default gateway, etc. - parameter /all will display even more
	tracert - shows packet path from source to destination, good for troubleshooting
	pathping - ping plus tracert
	arp - resolves mac to ip
	route - configures a routing table

- Linux Commands
	ifconfig - can be used to assign an address, configure, or display current configuration
	tcpdump - filter TCP/IP packets to save for analysis
	iptables - manage tables of IPv4 packet filter rules
	nmap - oh yeah, let's go. port scanner
	dig - queries dns servers for host addresses or server rules. similar to nslookup

- Wireless Specifications and Limitations
	Wi-Fi Router Position is often a limitation - try and keep it centralized
	Keep in mind that packet loss is a problem that presents itself as slow speed
	
	EIRP - measure of antenna power
	
	Reflection and absorption will cause disruptions

- Connectivity Considerations
	Incorrect Antenna aiming can be a problem on legacy access devices
	Channel utilization
	Antenna polarization, frequency, coverage, etc.
	Wireless Site Surveys should be performed prior to deployment and during troubleshooting

- Connectivity Issues
	Other Wi-Fi networks in the same range can cause interference
	Incorrect channel assignments can be a problem, particularly on older devices
	The more users, the less bandwidth-per-user

- Wired Network Considerations
	Crosstalk
	Duplex Mismatching
	Incorrect VLAN assignments
	Bad ports
	Interface configuration issues
	Bottlenecks
	Routing Tables - in larger environments, use dynamic routing instead of static or manual entries
	Damaged Cables

- Default Gateway Issues
	Just means the router that is used to access other networks
	
	If it's unreachable, that's a big problem
	169.254.0.0/16 means an IP was not able to be gathered from DHCP - also means there is no default gateway
	If no internet access needed, no need for default gateway

- Incorrect Netmask Issues
	A subnet mask is always "all ones" followed by "all zeroes"
		This basically means it's ones up until it switched from network to host
	Class A - 8 netmask bits, 126 networks
	Class B - 16 netmask bits, 16000 networks
	Class C - 24 netmask bits, 2100000 networks
	
	Make sure this is correctly configured, otherwise communication issues
	
- Duplicate IPs
	One or both may be disabled or have connectivity issues
	Usually a manual config issue - ensure statically assigned IPs never conflict
	Make sure DHCP scope excludes statically assigned IPs
	
- Duplicate MAC
	this SHOULD NOT happen
	Use ARP to discover MAC addresses
	
- Resolving DNS Issues
	If DNS is down, browsers report 'no internet access,' even though DNS is the issue
	Have a secondary DNS server in case first goes down
	
	When troubleshooting, start with most obvious, smallest scope, build outwards, make sure to check for malware/DNS poisoning
	nslookup can be used to test name resolution

- DHCP Scope
	Valid range of addresses to be leased to clients
	
	Scope issues
		Not activated
		Scope not large enough (limited scope)
		Service or server failed
		Client-side misconfiguration
		
- Rogue DHCP Server
	Unauthorized DHCP used to redirect clients
	Requires physical access to pull off
	
	Can be detected with ipconfig /all if correct address known
	Can mitigate with DHCP snooping, IDS, network monitoring
	
- Expired IP and Incorrect System Times
	Always a lease time for DHCP
	Typically you want to have more addresses than devices, but in places like cafes, shorter lease times are good so that unused IPs can be reassigned
	Fewer available IPs can be more secure - only the correct number of addresses can have IPs - may as well do static at this point
	Leases can be renewed
	
	Computer clocks can sometimes be inaccurate
	Kerberos has a small tolerance for time discrepancy
	Can use universal time servers to synchronize

- SSL Certificates and Blocked Ports
	Server Name Indication can not match up with certificate, or the certificate can be deleted, expired, etc.
	Traoubleshoot with SSL labs, Wireshark, etc.
	
	Blocked ports are, well, blocked
	Use a port scanner to check what is open and make changes if necessary

- Incorrect Firewall/ACL Settings
	Firewall issues
		Verify logs to check, verify the rules
		Check NAT - verifying where the wall is, before or after, can change how the firewall works

- Hardware Failures
	Diagnose switches with ping, physical, connectivity, and lights
	
- Services
	Configure on Windows with services console, cmd, powershell
	
	Unresponsive Services
		Check event viewer
		Windows Logs > Application
		Windows Logs > System
		
		Resolve: Restart, if stopped

- Wired Connectivity Issues
	Ethernet Collisions - packets run into each other in the wires
	Broadcast Storms - a system continually sending out broadcasts - this is bad, find it and stop it
	Multicast Flooding - similar to above, but an issue with a switch looking for a device
	Asymetric Routing Problems - multiple paths to the target
	Routing loop - it's a loop, message never reaches destination
	DHCP Scope exhaustion
	Missing Routes - usually an issue with a routing table, can't find device
	Optical Link Budget - how much of optical power available
	Certificate Errors
	Incorrect VLAN - usualy a device has been moved and is now using a new port/adapter
	Feature Licenses
