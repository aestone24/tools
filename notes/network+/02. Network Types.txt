Network Types

- Mesh Topology
	Rather unique
	
	Each computer on the network connects to all other computers
		Point-to-point connections for all
	
	Advantages
		Expand network without user disruption
		Nodes have dedicated links
		Fault identification is easy
		Total network failure very unlikely
		Multiple routes available for communication
	
	Disadvantages
		Complex installation
		More space required
		Multiple interfaces to maintain
		Utilization is low
	
	Topology Types
		Partial Mesh
		Full Mesh


- Star Topology
	By far the most common type of network
	All computers connect using a central node
	Popular for LANs
	
	Advantages
		Only failed nodes are affected by their failure
		Easy to modify, configure, and troubleshoot
		Fast performance, low traffic
	
	Disadvantages
		When a concentrator fails, brings down entire network (or all connected devices)
		Central node can be more expensive
		You can have heavy network traffic due to use of hubs - switches avoid this
		Concentrator capacity controls performance
	

- Bus Topology
	One single cable connects all nodes (goes through all devices)
	Two endpoints which need to be terminated (failing to do so will bounce signals)
	
	Advantages
		Lower cost
		Used for small or temporary networks
		Easy
		
	Disadvantages
		System may crash from cable fails
		Heavy traffic impacts performance
		Heavy traffic causes collisions
		Limited length cables
	
	Nobody even ever uses these. Never make one.


- Ring Topology
	Each device communicates with two neighbor devices
	Setup is in a... well, a ring.
	Only ever receive from one device, send to the other
	Like a bus but a closed loop
	
	Advantages
		Easy to install and reconfigure
		Device addition/deletion is easy
		Equal access to all network computers
		
	Disadvantages
		Unidirectional traffic
		Entire network can be taken down by one break
		Unpopular
		Topology signals always circulating - high power usage
		Difficult to troubleshoot
		Computer addition or removal can disturb the network
	
	Never make one. Never.
	

- Hybrid Topology
	Combination of two or more other topologies
	
	Advantages
		Mostly dependent on which topologies you combine
		
		Ease of error detection and troubleshooting (can know where an error is coming from)
		Can be highly flexible and effective
		Scalable
		
	Disadvantages
		Complex design
		Can be costly


- LAN, MAN, and WAN
	LAN
		Connect devices to allow sharing of data and resources
		Use private addressing schemes
		Connected by switches
		Very fast
		Easy design and maintenance
	
	MAN
		Covers area larger than LAN, smaller than WAN
		Covers a "regional geographic area"
		Common for organizations
		Designed for high-speed connectivity of many LANs
		Harder to design and maintain
		
		Less fault tolerant than a LAN
		More network congestion
		Costly
		Moderate transfer rate
		Moderate propogation delay
		
	WAN
		Large geographic area
		Supports "high speed" but nothing even close to LANs (maybe 1/10th)
		Propogation delay is a challenge
	

- WLAN, PAN, and CAN
	Wireless Local Area Network
		Wireless connectivity for devices - think WiFi
		
		Every device is a station
			Stations are either access points to the network (function as routers)
			Or they are clients (Includes a variety of devices)
			
	Personal Area Network
		A network specific to an individual
		Includes various devices - laptops, phones, printers, etc.
		Managed by a single device
		Can be accessed by any device
		Modem connected to internet provides wireless connections
		
		Technically a LAN
		
	Campus Area Network
		Connects multiple buildings in a large property
		Common for educational or corporate campuses
		Generally connects to public internet
		
		Smaller than MANs and WANs
		
		Security Benefits
			Usually managed by internal IT
			Easier to apply network security policies
			Can manage access and enable safeguards
		
		Effectively multiple LANs connected together and managed centrally
		
		Higher speed and lower cost than a MAN or WAN


- Peer-to-peer
	All nodes considered to be equal
	Usually consists of only client systems
	No dedicated servers
	Any system can act as a server or a client at any time
	
	Workgroups
		Microsoft Implementation of Peer-to-peer
		All members configured with same workgroup name
		Simplifies sharing of resources
		No centralized management
	
- Client/Server
	Devices have specific functions
	Client systems make requests to servers
	Servers perform tasks for clients
	
	Domains
		Microsoft implementation of a client/server network
		Dedicated servers manage a single directory of all users and computers
		Client systems join domain
		Centralized administration and management


- Storage Area Networks
	Dedicated and high-speed
	
	Created for servers to access data at the "block" level
		Can "block off" any amount of storage for a server - could be less than a hard drive, could be multiple drives
	
	Storage appears local to host
	
	Benefits
		Improved availability
		Redundency
		Enhanced performance
		Lots of storage
		Can just add more storage to one server instead of adding more servers
		Better management of storage
		Disaster recovery
		Very easy to scale
	

- Multiprotocol Label Switching
	Used to ensure reliable connections for real-time applicatoins
	
	More of a technique than a service
	Expensive
	
	Compare this to tracking a package as it passes through multiple destinations on the way to you
	
	MPLS establishes highly efficient, pre-determined routes
	As a packet enters the network, it gets a forwarding equivalence class (FEC)
	All network routers have a table that specifies how specific FEC-type packets should be handled
	Allows routers to send each packet along the optimal route - eg. using low bandwidth for recordings
	
	Features
		Not bound to a tech
		Designed to improve performance
		Used between branch offices or enterprises using real-time apps
	
	MPLS Label components
		Label value
		Experimental - used for QOS/prioritization
		Bottom-of-stack - Informs the last router that it's the last router
		TTL - time-to-live - tells it how many hops to take before being discarded
		
	Pros
		Scalable
		Reduced congestion
		Secure
		Better bandwidth utilization
		Not vulnerable to DoS
	
	Cons
		No encryption
		Very expensive
		Challenging to deliver coverage globally
		Not designed to work with cloud


- Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation
	A point-to-point tunnelling protocol
	
	Allows two devices to directly communicate
	
	Create only one tunnel interface on each router
		Builds the rest of the tunnels automatically from one starting GRE
	

- Service-related Entry Points
	Demarcation point - everything your side of this is your responsibility - barrier from LAN to WAN
	Smartjack - an intelligent device that provides a demarcation point


- Hypervisor
	Separates OS from applications and hardware
	Allows host to run multiple VMs as guests to maximize resource use
	
	Type 1 - Native or bare metal; lightweight
	Type 2 - hosted; First, install an OS, then add a hypervisor on top of it


- Virtual Switch
		Application that permits communication between VMs on a network
		Directs communication by checking packets before sending
		Embedded in software
		Can connect to NIC
		VMs believe they're connected to a physical switch


- Virtual Network Interface Card
	Used to connect virtual machines with other nodes
	Responsible for managing network communication
	
	VMs can have one or more of these
	

- Network Function Virtualization
	Decouples network functions from hardware and runs them on software
	Complements using software-defined networking
	Focuses on network service optimization
