Cables and Connectors

- Copper Cables
	Shielded Twisted Pair - protects from interference (electrical signals, radio waves, magnetic)
	Unshielded Twisted Pair - Simple, less expensive, not protected
		Cat 5 - 100Mbps
		Cat 5e - 1Gbps
		Cat 6, 6a - 1Gbps, but up to 10Gbps depending on the distance
	
	Coaxial Cable
		Thick Ethernet and Thin Ethernet
		10BASE5 and 10BASE2 (Category, brodaband vs baseband, amount of times past the regular distance (100m) it could go)
		Used in early LANs
	
	Twin-axial
		Uses two conductors instead of one (twisted)
		Cost-efficient
		Used differential signalling


- Copper Termination Standards
	Defined by TIA/EIA-568A and TIA/EIA-568B
	Only difference between the two is color ordering
	
	Straight-through cabling
		Used when connecting devices like:
			Switch to router
			Switch to computer
			Hub to computer
			Devices which are different from each other
	
	Crossover cabling
		Used for
			Switch to switch
			Switch to hub
			Hub to hub
			Router to router
			Computer to computer
			Any two devices that are very alike


- Singlemode and Multimode Fiber Cabling
	From interior to exterior
		Core (clear)
		Cladding (fibreglass, flexible)
		Primary coating
		Strength members
		Cable jacket
	
	Single mode
		Designed to carry only a single mode (frequency)
		Dedicated and able to be used over longer distances
		More expensive
		Categories
			OS1: Indoor applications, up to 10km
			OS2: Outdoor applications, up to 200km
	
	Multimode
		Designed to carry multiple modes at one time
		Usable only over shorter distances
		Less expensive
		Categories
			OM1 - 10Gbps up to 33m
			OM2 - 10Gbps up to 82m
			OM3 - 40Gbps up to 300m
			OM4 - 40Gbps up to 550m
			OM5 - 28Gbps per channel over 4 channels


- Common Cable Connector Types
	Components
		Ferrule
		Connector body - structure that holds the ferrule
		Coupling mechanism - allows to interface
	
	Types
		Local connector (LC) - physically small, ferrule is only 1.25mm
		Straight tip (ST) - round, push in and twist lock
		Subscribor connector (SC) - square connector, two ferrules, duplex communication
		Mechanical transfer registered jack - two cores in one ferrule, multimode only
	
	UPC - ultra-physical contact - if something reflects at the end, it has a chance of reflecting straight back
	APC - angled-physical contact - will not reflect straight back
	
	Copper types
		Registered Jack RJ11 - really for phones
		RJ45 - standard for UTP
		F-type - domestic TV equipment, ground to satellite links


- Common Transceiver Types
	Converting electrical signals into light
	
	Common types
		Small-form factor pluggable (SFP)
			Upgraded version of GBIC, 1/2 volume of GBIC
			Data rate from 100Mbps to 4Gbps
		SFP+
			8Gbps/fibre
			10Gbps/ethernet or optical
		QSFP
			1Gbps per channel
			4 channels
		QSFP+
			10Gbps per channel
			4 channels
			Can be treated as one channel at 40Gbps


- Cable Management
	Patch panels - where all ethernet connections end up to be connected centrally
		Punchdown block - where the cables converge
		RJ45 used to connect to switches
	
	Cable Trays
		Used to run cables out of the way
		Separate power and data cables
	
	Uninterruptible Power Supply
		Backup and protection power
		Can be a big source of EMI


- Copper Ethernet Standards
	10BASE-T
		10 Mbps, baseband, twisted
	100BASE-TX
		CAT5 UTP straight-through
	1000BASE-T
		Cat5e, CAT6/6A, CAT7
	GBASE-T


- Fiber Ethernet Standards
	100BASE-FX
	100BASE-SX
		Shorter wavelength, less distance, cheaper
	1000BASE-SX
	1000BASE-LX
		Up to 5km
	10GBASE-SR
		30 to 50m
	10GBASE-LR
		Up to 10km
	
	Wavelength Division Multiplexing
		Create up to 18 channels on a cable
	Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing
		Better bandwidth, up to 88 channels, less distance
