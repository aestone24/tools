Registered Ports

- SQL Server
	TCP port 1433
		This will always be recognized as a SQL server
	
	Relational Database Management System
		Basis for modern databases
		Uses tables
		Tables use fields
		Individual entries known as records
		Supported by SQL
	
	SQL Actions
		Queries
		Insert new records
		Update records
		Delete records
		Set permissions
		
	Database Engine
		Relational engine - maintains connectivity between tables
		Storage engine - Stores data (on HDD)
	
	SQLOS
		Provides OS services to a database
	
	SQL Server Services and Tools
		Data management tools (data integration services, data quality services)
		Business Intelligence - examines and analyzes stored data

- SQLnet
	TCP port 1521 is default/registered (can be configured otherwise but it's a pain)
	
	Implemented by Oracle, networking software, happens to use SQL language
	Scalable, supports most protocols, media/topology support, network transparency, heterogeneous networking
	
	Configuration
		Needs to be on client and server (for port agreement) - already taken care of if using default port
		Files
			sqlnet.ora - tracing, encryption
			tnsnames.ora
			ldap.ora - ldap
			listener.ora - configure database listeners
			cman.ora - settings for connection

- MySQL Database Service
	TCP Port 3306
	
	Still SQL database management, but this is open source, technical support from Oracle
		
	Software to connect is also open source
	Free, but commercial licenses from Oracle are an option
	
	Compatible with most client/server systems (SQLServer or SQLnet)
	Compatible with embedded systems (mobile devices, eg.)
	
	Secure privilege and password system, encrypted
	
	Very scalable, but limited to 64 indexes per table (still pretty high)
	
	Clients and tools
		mysqldump
		mysqladmin
		MySQL workbench
	
	Client connections
		Any platform with TCP/IP
		Can also use named pipes (Windows) or Unix domain socket files
		
- Remote Desktop Protocol
	Port 3389 for TCP and UDP
	
	Means for remote management and access
		Easier to maintain applications this way
	
	Most versions of Windows have this by default
	Versions have been made for Apple macOS and open source
	
	Protocol
		Establishes dedicated network channel for exchanging information
		All data encrypted during session
		From all software perspectives, same as being at the system
	
	Properties
		Supports TLS and bandwidth reduction
		Smart card authentication
		Offers printer redirection (print from remote to local, or local to remote)
		128-bit encryption
	
	RDP Advantages
		Security
		Low cost
		Flexible
	
	Disadvantages
		Requires admins with knowledge of the technology
		If multiple servers on one public IP, will need to configure traffic to different ports to reroute to different servers
		There may be bottlenecks
		Requires reliable internet connections
		Possible downtime
		
- Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
	
	
	Used for video, voice, and IM realtime communications
	
	Session Attributes
		User capabilities
		Setup
		Management
		User availability
		User location
	
	Request/response protocol (like HTTP)
	Carries messages
	
	Requests
		Invite
		Bye (ends the communication)
		Update
		Ack
		Cancel (stops any pending request)
		
- Common IP Protocol Types
	TCP - covered in detail elsewhere
		Used for data transmission, involves acknowledgment
	
	User Datagram Protocol - UDP - no acknowledgment
	
	Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
		Network layer protocol
		Supporting protocol
		Error message standard
		Provides feedback on communication
		Pinging a router uses this

- Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
	Tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems
	Encapsulates various network layer protocols

- IP Security (IPsec)
	Provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality to a network
	Applied by encapsulating security payload (ESP) and authentication header (AH)
	
- Packet Switched Networks
	Connection-oriented protocols
		Used by endpoint devices to transmit devices
		Reliable service network
		TCP, for example
		
		Benefits
			Less error prone
			More reliable
			Data arrives in correct order
	
	Connectionless Protocols
		Communication without any prior arrangement
		UDP, for example
