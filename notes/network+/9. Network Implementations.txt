Network Implementations

- Ethernet Network Switches
	Physical connection, point-to-point communication
	Data-link layer
	
	Layer 3 switches also exist at network layer, can use IPs, higher port density, (technically also a router)

- Ethernet Network Routers
	Network layer
	Connect networks including internet
	
- Hubs and Bridges
	Hubs are like switches but no addressing - anything in goes out in every direction
	Active hubs boost signals, passive do not
	
	Bridges decide whether to forward from one side to the other or not
	No specific 1-to-1 traffic, but doesn't broadcast to anyone - just everyone in one direction

- Other devices
	Access points - data link layer, literally just give you acces to a network
	Load Balancer - divides up requests to different pieces of the network to avoid overload on any one system
	Voice Gateways - Connects network with telecommunications network - degraded. A repeater just amplifies a signal

- Firewall devices
	Examines packets as they arrive and allows them through or denies them according to rules
	Can be a piece of hardware or a software application
	
	Stateful can examie after the fact, stateless cannot

- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
	Monitors for malicious activity, collects data, and reports
	
	NIDS
		Network IDS - Installed at edge of network
	HIDS
		Host IDS - Software on client

- Network Service Devices
	Printers, eg.
	Networked security cameras
	Networked Physical Access Controls
	Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Sensors (HVAC)
	
- Voice over Internet Protocol
	Just making voice-based calls using IP
	Information compressed to reduce traffic
	
	Can be done either locally by sending out from devices to provider, or use Session Initiation Protocol on a server to act as a switch

- Internet of Things
	Collection of devices which communicate over the internet protocol

- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
	Collecting and analyzing data real-time
	Good for monitoring
	Master Terminal Unit, Remote Terminal Unit, Human Machine Interface

- Common Routing Protocols
	Spcifically how routers communicate
	
	Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
		LANs, WANs, Application Layer
		Informs other router by sending entire routing table
	
	Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
		Routers use Link State Advertisements, monitors topology
		Takes into account amount of existing traffic
		
	Enhanced Interior Gateway Protocol (EIGRP)
		Only inside a network
		RTP and DUAL
	
- Link-state vs Distance-Vector
	Distance-vector only takes into account the number of hops
	Link State uses SPF alg, takes congestion into account - more difficult to implement/maintain
	Hybrid routing falls in between the two

- Static and Default Routes
	Static - created manually
		Less processing and resource requirements
	Default Routing - uses default paths
		Only in stub networks
	
	Interior
		Within a system
		RIP, IGRP, OSPF
	Exterior
		Between Autonomous systems
		Exchange routing table info
		BGP

- Bandwidth Management
	Quality of Service
	Traffic Shaping
