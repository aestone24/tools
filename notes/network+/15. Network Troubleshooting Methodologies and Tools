Network Troubleshooting Methodologies and Tools

- Identifying the Problem
	Gathering information
	Start with physical problems, like power, or disconnected peripheral devices
	
	Next, identify symptoms
	
	Attempt to recreate the problem and document your steps
	
	Approach each problem individually, narrowing the scope, and then work your way out as the small problems have been eliminated as possibilities
	
- Establishing the Cause
	Finding the root cause and fixing it ensures a permanent fix
	
	List possible causes and prioritize based on likelihood
	
	Start with obvious questions when questioning - easiest solution is often right
	
	Use the OSI model as an idea of where to look next

- Testing Techniques
	Testing any theory of cause allows you to give it credit or deem it unlikely
	
	Theories need to be validating by confirming results

- Identifying Potential Effects
	If you don't have a perfect fix, make sure you understand the side effects of your workaround
	
	When attempting workarounds, document and note alternatives in case first choice doesn't work
	Always share documentation

- Resolving Problems
	Verify authority first - you may lack permission to fix it - if so, escalate and provide all the information you've gathered
	Escalation begins with the closest resource
	Resolve within your expertise
	
- Verifying System Functionality
	Essentially asking "did it work?"
	Confirm the *original* issue was resolved
	
	Move to mitigation after verification

- Documentation
	Always use each experience to update or create new documentation - it will help future you and your teammates
	Likewise, when stuck, check to see the documentation made by your other teammates
	
	List symptoms, corretive actions (fails and successes) and their results
	
- Specifications and Limitations
	Indicators include speed, packet loss, latency, and jitter
	Can optimize throughput with wired connections - problems can be solved by rebooting, disabling firewalls, going around faulty equipment
	
	Bandwidth = maximum transfer speed, latency is how long it actually takes to reach point A from point B - think how much data can be sent vs how fast it can travel
	Can optimize by eliminating non-essential traffic

- Network Cabling Applications
	Power over Ethernet can, obviously, use ethernet to power devices

- Attenuation, Latency, and Jitter
	First, cabling that doesn't meet standards, is outdated, or is not properly installed, may be the cause
	
	Interference
		Signal disruptions
		can be caused by magnetism
	
	Attenuation
		Reduction of strength over distance due to resistance
		Fix by using better materials and/or repeaters
	
	Latency
		Time for data to travel
		Fix by using better materials
	
	Jitter
		Deviation in a signal pulse
		Due to congestion, drift, route changes, or sequence order
	
	Duplexing issues
		Caused by mismatch, or old devices using half-duplex
	
- Troubleshooting Crosstalk and EMI
	Signals on one wire interfere with those on another
	
	NEXT refers to ability to reject crosstalk
	FEXT needs to take attenuation into account
	
	EMI caused by electromagnetic fields/disturbance
	Every source of electricity has an EMF

- Troubleshooting Opens and Shorts
	Open - connection not continuous to intended termination
	Short - short circuit
	
	Testing for opens - continuity tests and resistance tests
	Resolving opens - reconnect cables, replace cables, replace devices
	
	Causes of shorts - exposure to heat, vibration, etc., contact
	Symptoms - heat, network issues, power issues, collisions
	Testing for shorts - voltage tests, but make sure you know what voltage SHOULD be going at any point

- Duplex and Transceiver Mismatches
	Auto Negotiation - before transmission agrees, devices agree on configuration
	Recognizing Duplex Issues
		Late collision error - both devices will recognize different errors
		Eventually TCP frame becomes full and everything grinds to a halt
	
	Auto negotiate almost never fails, so go with that when able

- Bad ports, bottlenecks, and VLAN mismatches
	Switch problems
	
	Bottlenecks - imagine a multiple lane road closing down to one lane, causing backup
		Too much volume going through one place
	
	Configure trunking switches to same native VLAN

- Damaged Cables / Bent Pins
	Can cause
		Complete service disruptions
		Slow or intermittent performance
	
	Diagnosing
		Visible physical damage
		Check connectivity
	
	Bent pins
		Connectivity issues
		Performance issues
		Caused by improper seat, often
	Identifying
		Look at it. Is it bent?

- LED Status Indicators
	Solid Green Light
		Connectivity is present
		Successful connection to something on other end
	
	Flashing Green Light
		Rapid flashing - regular network traffic
		Slow flashing - some kind of issue
	
	Amber Lights
		If went from green to amber, usually a problem
		Otherwise, need to check device
	
	Alternating
		Rate usually matters - faster is usually fine, slower is usually a problem
	
- Cable Tools
	Cable stripper - used to expose internal wires
	Crimper - clamps a connector into place to make a connection
	Multimeter - measures voltage, amps, and ohms
	Tone generators/sensors - used to check where wall ports go
	Loopback plug - connector but no cable, used to test for electrical or signal problems in a device
	Punchdown tool - presses wire into connecction on back of a patch panel
	Cable tester - tests for continuity
	Wire map tester - checks that sequencing is correct on both ends of an ethernet wire
