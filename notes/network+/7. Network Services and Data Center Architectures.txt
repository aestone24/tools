Network Services and Data Center Architectures

- DNS Network Service
	Translates a domain name to an IP
	Used on internet and LAN

- DNS Namespace Structure
	Third-party DNS
		Reliable, fast, offers other services like controls and phishing protection
	
	Cloud-hosted DNS
		Usually included in a package
		Scalable, reliable, and available
	
	DNS Hierarchy
		Root level - about 15, has access to the next level down
		Top level - .com, .org, etc.
		Second level - The name before ".com", ".org", etc.
		Subdomain
		Host - they system you're looking for
	
	Forward and reverse zones
		Forward - Convert name to IP address, common for websites
		Reverse - find name from IP

- DNS SOA Records
	Zone contains single SOA record
	Record identifies a single authoritative server - the end server that delivers the appropriate website
	
	Structure
		Class
		Current zone - defines zone for which it's authoritative
		Type - SOA
		Primary master - name and IP
		Contact email
		Serial number - separates multiple copies of same zone (for redundency in case one goes down)
		Refresh time
		Retry time
		Expiration time

- Common DNS Record Types
	Name server records
		List servers for domain
		Permit other name servers
		More than one name server - additional servers to distribute load
		
		Fields
			Name
			AddressClass - Usually Internet (IN)
			RecordType - Nameserver (NS)
			Name Server Name - FQDN of responsible server
	
	A Records
		"Address" - equates name to IP address
		"AAAA" used for IPv6
	
	MX Records
		Mail exchanger records
		Needed if your domain is to receive emails
		
		Parameters
			Mail server
			Preference (if more than one)
	
	SRV Record
		Locates services available on network
		Query DNS for locations
		Allows efficient management and distribution
		
		Fields
			Domain name
			TTL - Time to live
			Class - Always IN
			Record type - SRV
			Priority
			Weight
			Port number - where the server is listening
			Target - FQDN of host
	
	Text Record
		Additional information about a named service
	
	Canonical Name
		AKA alias
		Assigns alternate hostname for the same server
			Maybe a server has two services on different ports
			Then you can name them according to the service
			Think www.example.com and ftp.example.com

- DNS Global Hierarchy
	DNS Structure
		One or more parts delimited by dots - more specific to the left (www > domain name > com)
	
	Begins with root (aka dot)
	Top-level
		.net
		.com
		.org
		.edu
		.us
		.gov
		.biz
	Secon-level domain
		company/host name
		.google
		.amazon
	Third-level subdomains
		.mail
		.drive
	Host names
		dc1
	
	Delegation
		Different server at each level
		Root points to top level to second level etc.
	
	Infrastructure
		Need an authoritative server for internal
		Every other server is an 'iterative resolver'
	
	Recursive lookup
		When a client asks its own DNS server to find a name
		That server sends queries to each server across the infrastructure before responding
	
	Zone transfers
		Replicates DNS recors onto different servers for redundency
	
	DNS Caching
		Server remembers ips for requestd names for a short time
		This way it can retrieve from cache instead of sending out a bunch of queries
		
		Needs a TTL - determines how long it will keep cached values
		
- DHCP
	Dynamic IP assignment, replaces manual assignment
	IP, gateway, subnet mask, DNS servers all managed
	
	DHCP Discover
		Broadcast to locate DHCP
		If no response, APIPA address self-assigned (169.254.0.0/16)
	
	DHCP Offer
		Server hearing Discover responds with Offer
		Gives IP address configuration
	
	DHCP Request
		Client accepts by broadcasting request
		Typically requests the first offer receiverd (could have multiple)
		Other servers will withdraw their offers
	
	DHCP Acknowledge
		Server accepts by sending DHCPAck message
		Includes lease duration and other information
		
		Can also have DHCPNack or DHCPDecline
			Only really occurs if there was an accidental duplicate IP offered (DHCPNack)
			Or when TCP/IP parameter are invalid (Decline)
	
	DHCPRelease
		Discards configuration to be able to request a new configuration

- Network Time Protocol
	Hierarchical
	
	Stratum 0
		Most accurate time sources - atomic clocks, GPS clocks, but they aren't in our LAN
		Servers will use this as the source to pass information
	Stratum 1
		Most accurate through network connection
		Synchronized by Stratum 0 reference clock
	Stratum 2
		Synchronized from Stratum 1 devies through network
		Less accurate than 1 and 0
	Stratum 3
		Synchronizes from stratum 2, same algorithm
		It's just further removed
		I'm noticing a pattern here
		They're just going to provide for stratum 4... who will provide for stratum 5
	
	Aim to only go as deep as stratum 2

- IP Address Management
	Microsoft specific
	Manages IPv4/IPv6 address infrastructure
	
	Multi-server managemnt also exists, discovering DNS and DHCP across AD forest
	Can update DHCP servers to avoid assignment of already aassigned IPs
	
	Can audit network for changes, advanced queried, can export audit findings and resolve problems
	
	Supports role-based access controls and groups
	
	Can also manage virtual address space

- Three-tier Network Architecture
	Deals with switches, not routers
	Divides into core switches (large devices, high throughput), distribution layer switches (high uplink speeds), and access switches (individual system connections)
	
- Software Defined Networking
	Similar to virtualization
	Allows implementation of software-controlled environment, making a network hardware-independent
	
	Benefits include programmability, abstraction, and centralized control/view

- Storage Area Network
	Using networking to access a bunch of storage drives
	Uses data blocks - all the drives become just one "storage space"
	Very fast and resilient
	
	Features
		Multiple paths to any piece of storage
		High-availability clusters
		High throughput and performance
	
	Fiber Channel
		Fiber optic infrastructure
		Uses Fiber Channel Protocol to access data
		Uses SCSI commands over the FiO network
		Name service to access - similar to DNS
		Directs traffic
		
		Dedicated switches, but isolates SAN from rest of network
		Expensive
		
	FCoE
		Above but over lossless ethernet
		Converged infrastructure
		More cost effective than FC
	
	Internet SCSI
		SCSI over TCP/IP
		Access block-level over ethernet, no Fiber Channel
		
		Manual IP config
		Network optimization
		Fast network adapters needed
		
		Can be over 10Gbps
		Flow control/frame size may need to be adjusted
		
		Relatively inexpensive

- Data Center Traffic Flow Patterns
	North-South
		Client to server, center to outside network
		Visualized top to bottom
		
	East-West
		Server to server in center
		Visualized left to right
		
- Spine and Leaf-network Topologies
	Two switching layers instead of three
	Just leaf and spine layers
	
	Relies on heavier east-west traffic
	
	Heavier emphasis on distribution layer, less north/south traffic
	
	No spanning tree protocol - less chance for looping/circular traffic
	Increased need for cables to ensure rendundent connections
	May require more fixed-port switches
	
	Scaling out instead of up (more devices instead of better devices)
	
- Colocation Data Centers
	Renting data centers from a third party
	Good for companies that can't afford/maintain their own center
	
	Providers may maintain equipment, but the data still belongs to you
	
	Benefits - lower cost, reduced staff, geographically available
