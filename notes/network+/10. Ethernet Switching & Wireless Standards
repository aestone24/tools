Ethernet Switching and Wireless Standards

- Data Virtual LAN
	Logical grouping of devices regardless of physical location
	Increases number of broadcast domains/only a portion of the network needs hear each broadcast
	
	Membership
		Static/manual - more control, more secure
		Dynamic/automatic - easier, based on info like MAC address
	
	Access link - computer to switch
	Trunk link - switch to switch

- Voice VLAN
	VLAN but for VoIP
	Switch can prioritize voice traffic - differentiate by MAC address
	Switch adds Voice VLAN tag
	
	Has a normal and security mode - security adds MAC verification
	
- Ethernet Switching Port Config
	Duplex. Full is both directions at once, half is one at a time
	
	Link Aggregation Control Protocol
		When ports are not being used, you can borrow their bandwidth and aggregate it
	Port Aggregation Protocol
		Proprietary to Cisco, but really the same as LACP
	
	Flow Control
		Reduces packet loss
	Port Mirroring
		Used entirely for diagnosing errors - copies outgoing traffic to another destination
	Port Security
		Prevents unknown devices from forwarding packets
	Jumbo Frames
		Just increases packet frame size to reduce overhead

- Media Access Control (MAC) Tables
	First 24 bits are assigned to an organization, last 24 assigned by vendor
	Data Link is subdivided into LLC and MAC sublayers

- Power over Ethernet
	Enables ethernet cables to carry power
	Common for VoIP, cameras, etc.
	100 to 1000+ meters
	PoE at 15.4W, PoE+ at 30W, and PoE++

- Spanning Tree Protocol
	Prevents loops in switching/bridging

- Media Access Control Methods
	CSMA/CD
	Regulates communication to correct collisions
	Carrier sense multiple access/collision detection
	Can be extended to collision avoidance - listening for an empty medium to send, announcing you'll send, then sending - not perfect
		Uses randomization for amount of time waited to avoid collisions
	
- Address Resolution Protocol
	Resolves an IP to a MAC address
	Works between layers 2 (MAC, data link) and 3 (IP, network)
	Requests systems to check their IP and respond with their MAC address
	
	Vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle, DoS, and session hijacking

- Neighbor Discovery Protocol
	Resolves IPv6 to MAC
	Effectively ARP for IPv6
	Can be used to detect duplicate addresses

- 802.11 Standards
	Variance in speed, transmission range, and frequency. Listed in that order for all below.
	
	802.11 - 1-2M, better, 2.4
	802.11a - 50M, worse, 5
	802.11b - 11, better, 2.4
	802.11g - 54, better, 2.4
	802.11ac - 433M to 1.3G, worse, 5
	802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) 14G with multiplexing, worse, 5

- Wireless Frequency/Range
	2.4
		450 to 600 Mbps
		150 feet indoors, 300 feet outdoors
		Goes through objects better
	5
		Multiple non-overlapping channels
		Higher speeds
		Clearer signals
		Less interference
		Shorter range

- WiFi Channels
	2.4GHz = 11 channels
	5GHz = 45 channels
	
	Channels in 2.4 overlap a bit - some specific choices (1, 6, 11) don't overlap with each other (but do with other channels)
	Channel width affects speed and volume of data

- Wireless Channel Bonding
	Can combine multiple adjacent channels together to offer better performance
	Started in 802.11n

- Service Set Identifier (SSID)
	The name you give your router
	
	Basic Service Set (Switch + hosts)
	Extended Service Set
		One or more BSS
		One access point
	
	Independent BSS
		Simplest IEEE 802.11 network
		Ad-hoc allows for direct communication bypassing a router

- Antennas
	Omni-directional - obvious
	Directional - can focus signal
	Yagi-Uda - Several cross-facing pieces with their own cross-facing pieces
	Parabolic Dish
	Bi-directional - forwards and backwards

- Wireless Encryption
	WEP - easily crackable, outdated
	WPA - 2003, better encryption, added data integrity
	WPA2 - network access control, better encryption. Uses AES algorithm
	Temporal Key Integrity Protocol - Encryption for wireless LANs
	AES-CCMP - higher security, approved for government, needs newer hardware

- Cellular
	GSM - 90% of mobile connections, 900MHz or 1.8GHz, compress data before sending
	TDMA - divides channels into three time slots, only listen to what's in your slot, allows more users
	CDMA - 2G/3G, multiplexing, 800MHz/1.9GHz, only pay attention to code that matches your transmission
	LTE - OFDMA, frequency ranges to divide into separate channels
	5G - Faster, lower latency

- MU-MIMO
	Multiple input/multiple output, many antenna on each end
	802.11ac is 3.47Gbps to 6.93Gbps
