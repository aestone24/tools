IP Addressing Schemes and Subnetting

- Public vs Private IP
	Public IP Addresses are those you will have access to anywhere you can access the internet
		Need to be unique accross all devices in the world
	Private IP addresses are reserved for internal environments... no access from the internet
		Addresses can be used by anyone, as long as its unique internally
	Private IP Subnets
		10.0.0.0/8 (8 network bits in 32-bit subnet mask)
		172.16.0.0/12 (16 network bits in 32-bit subnet mask)
		192.168.0.0/16 (24 network bits in 32-bit subnet mask)


- NAT vs. PAT
	Network Address Translation
		Map public to private IPs
		One-to-one or many-to-one
		Webservers require a public address to respond to - NAT translates all internal addresses to your one router's one address
		Types
			Static - Specifically translate based on pre-made rule
			Dynamic - Comes up with it on the spot
			PAT
	Port Address Translation
		A type of NAT that uses ports
		Many-to-one
		Uses the ports requests come through on to map where responses go
		Effectively has multiple hosts, but same IP, different port numbers
	

- IPv4 and IPv6
	IPv4
		32 bit address, written in base 10, split into four groups of 8 bits
		2^32 (4.3 billion) total addresses
		First 16 bits called network portion, last 16 are host portion
			Analogous to city/street, and then address
	
	IPv6
		128 bit address, written in hexadecimal, eight groups of four characters (16 bits)
		2^128 (3.4*10^38) total addresses
		Does not need/use NAT - all devices can have public addresses
		Built in authentication and privacy
		No private address collisions


- Automatic Private IP Addressing
	When DHCP is not present
	Automatic self-IP assignment
	
	IP address assigned using ARP - maps to MAC address
		Can only be used in-network
	Range is 169.254.0.0/16
	
	You don't want to be using it since it's only for internal access, no internet
	
	EUI-64 (Extended unique identifier)
		Host can assign a 64-bit IPv6 address (not a full address)
		Taken from 48-bit MAC address
		No need for manual configuration or DHCP
		First 24 bits at the start, 16 bits added in the middle, last 24 at the end


- Unicast, Broadcast, Anycast, and Multicast Packets
	Transmission Methods on IP networks
	
	Unicast
		One sender, one receiver
	
	Broadcast
		One endpoint sending information to all destinations
	
	Multicast
		Typically one sender but can be many, multiple receivers, all get the same information
		Same packet goes to each destination
		One receiving address, but multiple people are using it
		Uses UDP and IPv4
	
	Anycast
		Uses IPv6
		Nearest person receives


- Link Local, Loopback, and Default Gateway Addresses
	Default Gateway
		Allows communication between networks
		Routes Traffic
			Any number of private devices communicate with the gateway
			Data sent through the gateway takes the gateway's IP
			Inside the network private IPs can be used to connect with each other
		Options
			Routers - physical device, gateway is the protocol
			ISP - old, no longer used
			Servers (common in the case of internal environments)
	
	Loopback Address
		Loops
		IPv4: 127.0.0.1
		IPv6: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 aka ::1
		
		Can use this to test a new network adapter by pinging 127.0.0.1
	
	Link-local address
		Connectivity on local network only
		Single network
		Not routed
		APIPA (See above)
		Did not get assigned a valid address
		169.254.0.0/16
		IPv6: fe80::/64


- IPv4 Classes
	Class A - 1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.255.254 - Up to 16 million hosts on 127 networks (First 7 bits variable
	Class B - 128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254 - Up to 65,534 hosts on 16,000 networks (First 18 bits network, 16 bit range, Last 14 bits are hosts
	Class C - 192.0.1.1 to 223.255.254.254 - Up to 254 hosts on 2 million networks (The first 24 bits are network, last 8 are hosts, ignore 0 and 255)
	Class D - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 - Reserved for multicast
	Class E - 240.0.0.0 to 254.255.255.254 - Reserved for research


- Subnetting Fundamentals
	Routers do not connect hosts to each other
	192.168.0.0 - ending in 0 indicates there is no host - don't send it
	Ending in 255 is the broadcast address - sends to all hosts on the network
	Subnetting is the act of dividing up the "host address" section into smaller sections to make smaller networks
	Subnet mask is a series of "1" bits for the "network address,"
	

- Subnetting a Class C Network
	Breaking down a network into smaller units!
	Subnetting effectively splits "masks" a number of the host address bits
	This means that the network portion increases in size (by adding x bits) and decreases the host portion (by removing x bits)
		This give 2^x subnets with 2^(host portion - x) number of available devices each
	The number of available host addresses does not change, just how they're classified (into which subnet)
	

- Subnetting a Class B or A Network
	Take exactly the same process
	A subnet is all "1" bits up until where you start the "host address" and end the "network address"
	Increasing the size of the network address is functionally the same as subnetting - you're just creating more networks in the range.


- Supernetting Strategies
	Effectively the opposite of subnetting - take multiple networks and combine them together
	Using supernetting you can expose more bits to the host portion - bigger network
	I suppose this requires owning two networks right next to each other in terms of IPs to combine
	Removes the need for routers to connect between networks


- Calculating Subnet Boundaries
	In every subnet, all 0s will be network, all 1s will be broadcast
	Boundries are always on the subdivisions of the first x bits (which were assigned to network address)


- IPv6 Addressing Solutions
	IPv6 Dual Stack
		Aids transition from v4 to v6
		Devices can use v4 and v6 at the same time
		Traffic can be processed simultaneously
	
	IPv6 Tunneling
		Can communicate IPv4 packets by encapsulating them into IPv6 packets
		Useful if any intermediaries use IPv6
	
	IPv6 Shortening
		Any section of four characters beginning with a 0 can be changed by removing all leading 0s prior to last character
		If all are 0s, can shorten to :: (can only be done once per address, but implies everything between the two is all 0s)
	
	Stateless Address Autoconfiguration
		Can be stateful or stateless
		Host can generate address using local and remote information
		Prefixes advertised by router
		
		If no router, link-local is generated


- Layer 3 Subinterfaces
	Can assign multiple addresses to the same interface so it can exist in two networks - i.e. a router
	
	Can use this for VLAN traffic routing


- Virtual IP Addressing
	An IP address can be assigned to multiple devices
	Requests get redirected to a real address, but client only sees the one virtual IP address
	
	AKA Content distribution
