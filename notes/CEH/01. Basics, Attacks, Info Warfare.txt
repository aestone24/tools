Basics, Attacks, Info Warfare

- Basic Cybersecurity Concepts
	Confidentiality }
	Integrity       } - CIA Triad/Iron Triangle
	Availability    }
	Authenticity - Identity, methodology, etc. can be confirmed as the "right" thing
	Non-Repudiation - You can verify that someone did something

- Motives, Goals, and Objectives
	Curiosity
	Bragging Rights
	Disruption of Business
	Hacktivism - can be political
	Religious reasons
	Terrorism
	Cyber Crime - i.e. theft, blackmail

- Attack Classifications
	Passive Attacks
		Searching on the network, i.e. clear text passwords
		Really just looking for things - credit cards, PII, etc.
		Sitting back and observing
		Difficult, near impossible, to detect
		
	Active Attacks
		Not passive - actually poking at things, can be detected
		DoS/DDoS, compromising systems/network, password attacks, session hijacking, privelege escalation, SQL injections, remote code execution
		
	Close-In Attacks
		Gathering information through proximity - i.e. just go into the employee lounge and listen/watch
		Shoulder surfing, dumpster diving
		
	Insider Attacks
		Aka insider threats
		Abusing trust
		Can use data exfiltration, pod slurping, i.e.
		Just walking out with stuff
		Can heavily overlap with close-in attacks
		Can be malicious, careless, etc.
	
	Distribution Attacks
		Includes supply-chain attacks
		Find a provider to your target and get in through breaching the provider

- Information Warfare
	C2/C&C
		Command and Control
		Command over compromised systems with centralized management
	
	Intelligence-Based
		The design and protection of systems that seeks sufficient knowledge to dominate the battle space and denial of such knowledge to adversaries
		
	Electronic
		Signal/radar jamming
	
	Psychological
		Creating mass confusion
		Scare tactics
		Getting everyone to give up
		Use of terrorism or propaganda
	
	Hacker Warefare
		The "soldiers"
	
	Economic
		Disrupting your opponent financially can reduce their influence
		
	Cyber-warfare
		Much like information warfare
		Semantic attack - taking over a system where the appearance of normality is maintained
		Simulated Warfare - acquisition and display of: weapons, power, etc.
	
	Strategies
		Defensive and Offensive
